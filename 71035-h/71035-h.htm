<p>Hannah Hindes did not know what answer
to make to this direct appeal. She
was an honest woman, to whom a lie was
an abhorrence, but she was also a woman
who held her husband’s reputation, perhaps
his life, in her hands. She hesitated so
visibly, that Captain Hindes began to think
his brother’s disorder must be such as she
found it impossible to speak to him upon.</p>

<p>‘Well, never mind,’ he said presently,
‘I see you are unwilling to mention it, but
I shall soon get it out of old Hal. But
you make me feel rather anxious, Hannah.
If my brother has not consulted a doctor,
I must make him do so. His health is too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
valuable to you and the children to be
trifled with. By the way, talking of children,
what induced you to send those two
little fairies, Elsie and Laurie, away from
home to be educated? I thought that was
altogether against your principles, Hannah.
Edith says she remembers your giving her
a long lecture on the subject when Fanny
was born, and cautioning her never to let
a daughter be educated anywhere but at
home. She has dinned it into my ears
whenever I have hinted the young lady
was old enough to go to school.’</p>

<p>‘Yes!’ replied Hannah, with a sigh.
‘Those have always been my sentiments,
Arthur, and are so still. But Henry has
grown so irritable of late, that the noise
of the children playing about The Hall
disturbed him, so I thought it best to
let them go. They are with an old
friend of mine, where I can see them
almost every day. I daresay,’ she continued,
timidly, ‘that you thought it
very strange that we could not receive
you at The Old Hall, as we did before.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
It cost me more than I can tell you to
write and put off your coming here.
But it was for the same reason. My
husband cannot bear the least noise or
confusion. I am afraid he has over-taxed
his brain, and, when he returns
home, he requires absolute rest.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t say anything more about it,
Hannah,’ replied her sister-in-law. ‘Of
course, Artie and I knew there was
some unavoidable reason for the refusal.
And, much as we should have liked to
renew our former pleasant relations with
you, everything must give way to Henry’s
health.’</p>

<p>‘What are your plans?’ inquired
Hannah.</p>

<p>‘We have hardly fixed them yet,’
said Captain Hindes. ‘We thought of
staying in town for a while, just to see
a few theatres and other amusements,
while we look out for a country cottage
to spend the summer in. But if my
brother is seriously ill, I shall not dream
of going far away from him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, Arthur! he is not so ill as that!’
exclaimed Hannah; ‘it is his mind that is
suffering, rather than his body. He works
so hard at the business, and now, of course,
everything falls on his shoulders. He seldom
gets to the City before noon, and,
when he comes home, he is so exhausted,
he cares for nothing but to go to bed.’</p>

<p>‘But neuralgia is generally due to physical
weakness, Hannah. The doctors always
give Edie a tonic for it the first thing.
Is Hal taking nothing to strengthen him?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think he takes anything but
morphia when the pain becomes intolerable,’
replied Hannah; ‘but, Arthur, don’t
argue with him on the subject. Nothing
makes Henry so irritable as to be talked
to about his health. When you see him,
treat him as if you saw no difference in his
appearance. He won’t let even <i>me</i> mention
the subject to him.’</p>

<p>‘He must be mightily changed,’ said
Captain Hindes, sighing; ‘however, I will
take your advice, and keep silence on the
matter. I shall call at his office the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
thing to-morrow. When do you think I
shall find him there?’</p>

<p>‘Not before twelve, Arthur; if then.
Will not you and Edith have some refreshment
before you go back?’</p>

<p>‘No, thank you, Hannah. We are both
tired, and should not have moved out except
to see you. Tell old Hal all about us
when he wakes up, and say I shall be in
Sise Lane early to-morrow. Good-night,
my dear. I’m awfully sorry about his illness.
It’s quite spoilt my coming home,
but I hope I may be able to cheer him up.
If it is due, as you seem to imagine, to his
over-working himself, I think I shall be
able to persuade him to come out a little
with me, and brush the cobwebs off his
brain. What need has he to ruin his
health by work? He has made plenty of
money, to say nothing of the handsome
legacy that Mr Crampton left the son and
heir. By the way, how is the prodigy?
I conclude he has not left home as well as
the girls.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Hannah, with a wintry smile;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
he is not quite old enough for that yet.
He will not be three till his next birthday.
He is quite well, thank you, Arthur; but
I have to keep him at the top of the house,
for fear he should disturb his father.’</p>

<p>‘Why, Henry was always so devoted
to Master Wally. Edie and I have often
laughed together over his letters about
his little son, and said, surely no man had
ever had a boy before. At one time he
could write of nothing else.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! yes, and he loves the child as
much as ever, perhaps more, but he cannot
stand his noise. It jars upon his nerves.
Sometimes I long for the time when
Wally shall be able to go too. It is a
dull life for a young child to be confined
to the company of his nurse.’</p>

<p>‘You grieve me more and more with
each word you say, Hannah,’ replied
her brother-in-law; ‘however, I shall
see Henry for myself to-morrow.
Come! Edie, we must make tracks for
our hotel.’</p>

<p>‘Won’t you wait for the carriage to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
take you back,’ asked Hannah anxiously,
for she was distressed at not being able
to show them more hospitality.</p>

<p>‘No, thanks, dear. We shall get home
quicker by the Metropolitan. We shall see
you again soon. Good-night!’ and, with
his wife’s arm snugly tucked under his own,
Captain Hindes walked off again.</p>

<p>As soon as she was sure that they were
gone, Hannah sat down and indulged in
the luxury of ‘a good cry.’ It was seldom
that she permitted her feelings to get
the better of her, but this interview had
upset her.</p>

<p>The semi-deceit she had been compelled
to practise—the determination of Captain
Hindes to find out what was the matter
with his brother, and the evident suspicion
with which he had received her statements,
all combined to make her fear that a crisis
of some sort was at hand. She dreaded
what her husband might do or say if his
brother pressed him too hard for an explanation
of the alteration in his demeanour
and appearance. His brain was at times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
so muddled, even in the day-time, that he
spoke more like a madman than a sane
person, and if Arthur took it upon himself
to consult medical men on Henry’s behalf,
or to have him privately watched, what
terrible <i>dénouement</i> might not be the consequence.
She wished heartily that her
brother and sister-in-law had not returned
home just at that particular moment, that
they had given her time to coax her husband
to leave England for a while, as he
had seemed so well disposed to do, but
wishing was futile. They were there, in
their midst, and she must set all her wits
to work to conceal the real state of affairs
from them.</p>

<p>She visited her husband’s bed-chamber
at once, to find him sunk into a slumber,
from which she could only rouse him to a
semi-torpid condition. So she wisely let
him sleep until the morning, when he was
able to listen to her story, and conceive
a hazy idea that his brother and his wife
had paid The Old Hall a visit whilst he
was asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>When Captain Arthur Hindes walked
into the office the following day, he found
his brother had not yet arrived. Naturally
he was well-known there, by Mr
Bloxam and all the older employés of the
firm, and he received a hearty welcome,
for he was a general favourite. Arthur
was taller and fairer than Henry—had a
handsomer face and a neater figure—was
possessed, moreover, of a bright, happy
temperament, and had always a kind word
or a jest on hand.</p>

<p>‘Not arrived yet?’ he exclaimed in
answer to Bloxam’s intimation of the
‘governor’s’ absence, ‘and nearly half-past
twelve! What makes him so late,
Bloxam? He used to be called “the
early bird” at one time.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! Master Arthur, things are changed
since then,’ replied the old cashier. ‘Mr
Henry’s not been nearly so active of late.
I often think he’s not well. He seems so
mopey and dull. Perhaps it will be different
now you’ve come home, Mr Arthur.
You’ll cheer him up a bit. He has felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Mr Crampton’s death terribly, and Miss
Jenny’s too, for the matter of that, they
came so quickly, one after the other, and
he ought to have taken a change long ago.
I’m very glad you’ve come back, sir.
You’ll do him more good than anyone
else could do.’</p>

<p>‘I am glad also, Bloxam, for Mrs
Hindes’s account of him quite alarmed
me. But do you think he is really ill?’</p>

<p>‘I think he is very, <i>very</i> ill, Mr Arthur,’
returned Bloxam, mysteriously; ‘but here
he is, so I will leave you together.’</p>

<p>Saying thus, the cashier retreated by a
side door into his particular sanctum, as
the glass doors from the front swung
slowly on their hinges, as though propelled
by an enfeebled hand, to admit
Henry Hindes. He entered, looking much
as he had always done of late, slouching
along with a bent figure and a shaking
frame. He had made some attempt, at the
instigation of his wife, to brighten up his
general appearance by assuming a frock
coat and a tall hat, but they only served<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
to make the difference in him more apparent.
Captain Hindes could not for a
moment believe the evidence of his senses,
but when he was convinced that it was his
brother who stood before him, he started
forward to greet him with a slight cry.</p>

<p>‘Good God! Hal, my dear old fellow!’
he exclaimed, ‘is this you?’</p>

<p>‘Who else?’ demanded Henry, with an
attempt at jocularity, as he held out his
hand and grasped that of Arthur.</p>

<p>The younger man looked him in the
face for a few minutes without speaking.
He could not trust himself to do so. He
was too infinitely shocked. <i>This</i> Henry?
Henry, whose devotion to his personal
appearance had passed into a family proverb—who
had always been the ‘nattiest’
youth, and the most perfectly-dressed young
man, and the most faultless gentleman in
the City—whose irreproachable garb and
spotless linen and glossy hats had been
cast in his teeth in bygone days, as witnesses
that he was not fit for business or
anything but a <i>cavalier des dames</i>. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
limp, untidy, slovenly-looking man, with
bloodshot eyes, and unhealthy complexion,
his brother Henry, of whom he used to be
so proud? Arthur felt a great lump rise in
his throat, and could have sat down and
cried to see the difference a few years had
made in him. But he held his hand as in
a vice instead, and replied in as hearty a
voice as he could manage,—</p>

<p>‘Why, dear old chap, you’re not looking
yourself at all. You took me quite by
surprise, though Hannah did prepare Edie
and me last night to see a change in you.’</p>

<p>‘Hannah, Hannah!’ cried his brother
quickly; ‘what had she to say of me?
What did she tell you? How dared she—I
mean, why did she mention me at all?’</p>

<p>‘My dear Henry, it would have been
very extraordinary, surely, if she had not
mentioned you, considering that we went
over to Hampstead to see you, and were
much disappointed to find you had already
retired to bed. You want shaking up, old
fellow, that’s what it is. You’ve been
worrying yourself over this big business too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
much. Your late partner’s death has thrown
too much responsibility upon your shoulders.
How I wish I were not such a fool, and
could help you a little. But now that I
have returned, you must come out more,
Henry. It is quite time you came back to
the world. It is—let me see!—quite nine
months or more, surely, since that poor girl
met with her death—’</p>

<p>‘Stop! stop!’ cried Henry suddenly.
‘What poor girl? What are you talking
about?’</p>

<p>Arthur looked bewildered.</p>

<p>‘Why! Miss Crampton, or rather Mrs
Walcheren, of course. It was her death,
wasn’t it, that led to the other. You must
have felt it terribly. Such a sudden shock,
and when you regarded her as almost one
of the family.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! no, I didn’t,’ replied Hindes, in an
incoherent manner. ‘Why should I have
felt it? She was nothing to me. I didn’t
care about her. Why, to hear you talk in
that extravagant way,’ he continued, turning
his suspicious eyes upon his brother, ‘one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
would think—one would almost imagine
that I had had something to do with it all.’</p>

<p>‘Something to do with it,’ repeated
Arthur, in a distressed tone of voice. ‘Oh,
Henry! how can you say such a thing!
But you felt it deeply, I am sure. Anyone
could see that from your altered appearance.
But, my dear brother, there is such
a thing, you know, as giving way too much
to our feelings. You have lost two of
your dearest friends, but you have your
wife and children left. You must think of
them, Henry, and also a little of me, of
whom you are the last surviving relative.
For all our sakes, dear old chap, try and
rouse yourself from this morbid condition.
A little amusement and gaiety will
do you good. Hannah should have urged
you to go out again before this. But, now
that I have come home, I mean to persuade
you to it, for my own sake as well as
yours. Will you?’</p>

<p>‘Of course I will,’ replied Henry, sitting
upright in his chair, and trying to look as
if there were nothing the matter with him;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
‘we will go out together, Arthur, and have
some larks as we used to do. I’m as fit as
a fiddle. It’s only Hannah who will have
it I’m ill. Women are such coddles. But,
now you are come, it will be all right.
Let’s make a night of it. Where shall we
go? Tivoli first, and a little supper at
Gatti’s afterwards. Will that suit you,
Artie? By Jove! the very sight of you
has done me good.’</p>

<p>‘I’d rather go to the theatre to-night,
Henry. I shouldn’t like to leave my little
woman at home by herself, the first evening
she spends in England. We will do
the music-halls afterwards. What do you
say to this? Come straight to Haxells’
from the office, and dine with us. I will
wire for Hannah to join us, and we’ll
make a party to the Lyceum in the
evening. I can go now and secure a box.
Will you do it, Henry? Do say yes!’</p>

<p>‘Of course I’ll do it, Arthur. What has
my wife been telling you—that I’m not
able to go to theatres and places of that
sort? It’s lies, I tell you—all lies. I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
as fit as they’re made. All right, Bloxam.
I’ll attend to you in a minute.’</p>

<p>‘I’d better go now, Henry, and leave
you to your work,’ said Captain Hindes,
with a perplexed face, ‘you’ll get on better
without me. Don’t forget. Haxells’ at
five, and we’ll dine there, and spend the
evening at the theatre. And I’ll telegraph
to your wife at once that she may make
no engagement for to-night. Good-bye
for the present, dear old fellow. I’m
awfully glad to have met you again Hal.
Good-bye till this evening.’</p>

<p>But though he had said he was awfully
glad, Captain Hindes looked awfully sad
as he took his way back to the hotel to
tell his wife of his interview with his
brother. He fulfilled his engagements,
secured a box at the theatre, sent Hannah
an invitation by wire, and ordered a good
dinner to be ready for the party at six.</p>

<p>But Hannah came, and the dinner came,
yet there was no appearance of Henry
Hindes. After some delay, Arthur volunteered
to go back to the City and see if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
had yet left the office. On reaching it, he
was told that the ‘governor’ had been
gone some time, and the clerk, who carried
his papers to the hansom, had heard him
distinctly give the order to drive to Hampstead,
so the only thing his brother could
do, was to jump into another hansom and
follow him there. He expected to find
Henry had mistaken the time of meeting,
or had returned home to dress for the
theatre, which, he had told him, was unnecessary.
The man who opened the door
of The Old Hall looked so surprised to
see him, that Arthur’s first inquiry was,—</p>

<p>‘Has not your master returned?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir, he has been home the best part
of an hour.’</p>

<p>‘Where is he?’</p>

<p>‘In the library, I think, sir.’</p>

<p>Captain Hindes did not wait to be announced,
but hastened to the library by
himself. He found his brother seated in
an arm-chair doing nothing, with his hands
folded on his lap.</p>

<p>‘Hullo!’ cried Arthur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>Henry started as if he had been shot,
and exclaimed,—</p>

<p>‘Good God!’ Then, turning towards the
intruder, said angrily. ‘How dare you
startle me in that way? I have told you
again and again—’</p>

<p>‘Hal! Hal! it is I—Arthur,’ replied the
captain, quickly.</p>

<p>Henry Hindes turned a lack-lustre eye
upon him, and said in a tone of surprise,—</p>

<p>‘Arthur? but where have you come
from? Why didn’t you let me know you
were coming home? We should have
sent the carriage or something to meet you.</p>

<p>‘Henry, old boy, what are you talking
of?’ said Captain Hindes. ‘Why, I
saw you at the office this morning, and
you promised to dine with us this evening,
and go to the theatre afterwards. Your
wife is already in town, and I have come to
see why you have not joined us. Had you
forgotten your engagement? Why did
you not come straight to Haxells’, as you
promised?’</p>

<p>‘Did I promise?’ asked his brother in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
stupid way. ‘I suppose I have forgotten
it! I have so much business to think of.
But I had better tell Hannah I am going
with you, or she will wait dinner for me.’</p>

<p>‘I left Hannah with Edith, Hal, and the
sooner we join them the better. I have
my cab at the door, so come at once, like
a good fellow,’ said Arthur Hindes, who
was beginning to feel seriously uneasy
about his brother.</p>

<p>He persuaded him to accompany
him back to town, however, and in
another half-hour they had all sat down
to dinner. Captain Hindes marked the
anxious look in his sister-in-law’s eye, as
he related how he had found his brother;
but Henry picked up considerably during
dinner, and even attempted some feeble
attempts towards jocularity, which were
accompanied, however, by such a silly, cackling
laugh, that his wife’s cheeks burned
with shame to listen to him, and Arthur
tried by all means in his power to cover
his shortcomings by talking a great deal
more nonsense than was his wont.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>‘I am sorry,’ he said, as they started for
the theatre, ‘that I was unable to procure
a box at the Lyceum. Everything was
booked there for three weeks in advance,
but I got seats at another theatre, which I
daresay will prove just as amusing.’</p>

<p>‘I shall like anything, naturally,’ replied
Edith; ‘but you, Hannah, see so many
pieces, I suppose, that you may be fastidious.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, you are mistaken,’ said
Hannah, with her quiet smile. ‘Henry
does not care, as a rule, to go out after
dinner, and I cannot, of course, go without
him. An evening at the theatre is
almost as great a treat to me as to you,
Edith.’</p>

<p>The theatre which Captain Hindes had
selected was one of those which provide
melodrama for the public amusement.
There happened to be a very stirring
piece on there at that moment, full of sensational
scenes of murder, assault, and
robbery. The murder was committed in
the prologue, and the story dragged through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
three long acts afterwards, during which
the assassin was being hunted down until
he was finally brought to justice.</p>

<p>As soon as Hannah understood what
they were likely to see, she became anxious
and troubled on her husband’s account,
although she took great pains to conceal
her feelings. The two ladies were seated
in front of the box, whilst the gentlemen
occupied the spaces behind their chairs.
She could not, therefore, see her husband’s
face, but she sympathised with him all
through the play. She fancied that the
conversation between the brothers grew
less and less as the piece proceeded, but
that might be due to the fact that they
had become interested in it. Her worst
fears were, however, realised, when, as they
were watching a scene in which the murderer
betrayed himself to a woman, who
had been on his track from the beginning,
she suddenly heard Henry exclaim,—</p>

<p>‘This is an insult! I will stand it no
longer. I consider you had no right to
bring my wife to see such a piece as this.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>Captain Hindes started to his feet at
once, the two ladies looked round in
amazement, and Hannah said, in an
agonised whisper,—</p>

<p>‘Hush, Henry, hush, for Heaven’s sake!
You will attract public notice. I am enjoying
the play immensely. Do sit down
and be quiet.’</p>

<p>‘I will not sit down,’ he continued,
loudly. ‘I will not stay another moment
in this damned place. Here, Hannah, put
on your cloak and bonnet at once, and come
home with me. You sha’n’t hear another
line of it.’</p>

<p>Hannah glanced at her brother and
sister-in-law with infinite distress, which
their looks returned, but, rising hastily,
she whispered to Arthur,—</p>

<p>‘Don’t make any fuss. Let me go
home with him. He is not well. Forgive
me, Arthur; forgive us both, but
don’t try to persuade him to stay.’</p>

<p>She threw her mantle over her shoulders
as she spoke, and, putting her hand through
her husband’s arm, said gently,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>‘Come, dear, I am quite ready to go
home. Good-night, dear Arthur and Edie.
Thanks so much,’ and, with that, she drew
him quickly away.</p>

<p>When they had disappeared, Captain
and Mrs Hindes looked at each other in
sorrowful surprise.</p>

<p>‘What <i>is</i> the matter with him?’ asked
Edith of Arthur. ‘Is he <i>mad</i>?’</p>

<p>‘I am very much inclined to believe it,’
replied her husband. ‘There is certainly
something very wrong about him, and I
shall speak to a doctor on the subject to-morrow.
Hannah says he has refused to
see anybody, but, when a man begins to
be as unreasonable as this, it is time his
friends acted for him. I have not had
time to tell you how I found him this
afternoon, but I will when we get home.’</p>

<p>‘I would rather return now if you have
no objection, dearest,’ said Mrs Hindes.
‘This <i>contretemps</i> has taken away all my
interest in the play. Poor Hannah! how
I pity her.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p>Henry and Arthur Hindes had been the
only children of their parents, and, as
young men, had been much attached to
each other; Arthur, perhaps, caring for
Henry more than Henry did for him, as
he joined admiration of his elder brother’s
abilities and address to his affection. His
principal thought in coming home had been
the meeting with Henry again, and the
reality proved a bitter disappointment to
him. He lay awake half the night trying
to find some reason for his brother’s unaccountable
conduct, but was unable to
think of any illness, except that of the
brain, that could make him behave in so
extraordinary a manner.</p>

<p>He determined, therefore, that, whether
Henry liked it or not, it was his duty to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
consult a specialist on his behalf, and get
him, if possible, to pay him a visit. His
first action, therefore, in the morning was
to inquire for and gain an interview with
an eminent brain doctor, to whom he related,
as well as he was able, all that had
occurred since his arrival in England.</p>

<p>The great man listened to him with
polite attention and in perfect silence. He
was a slender, delicate-looking man, with a
bald head, mild eyes and a pale complexion.
No novice, to look at him,
would have imagined that that quiet eye
of his had the power to quell the ravings
of the greatest lunatic who ever tried to
dash his keeper’s brains out. But, as he
sat quietly with clasped hands and gazed
at him, Captain Hindes felt his influence
without inviting it.</p>

<p>‘A sad story, Captain Hindes,’ he said,
when Arthur had finished; ‘and it may be
you have guessed the truth. But no
disease is so subtle as that of the brain,
and I can give no opinion without seeing
your brother.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>‘I am so afraid he would not admit you,’
replied Arthur. ‘His wife tells me he has
such an abhorrence (forgive the term) of
all medical men. But someone <i>must</i> see
him. I feel sure of that.’</p>

<p>‘Could you not introduce me as a friend
of your own? Under any circumstances,
you could not tell him who I am. It
would defeat my efforts. I must observe
him quietly and by myself,’ said Doctor
Govan.</p>

<p>‘He is so morose and apparently averse
to any company,’ replied Arthur. ‘I suppose
you could not manage to see him at
his office on pretence of doing business?’</p>

<p>‘No, I’m afraid I should not play the
<i>rôle</i> of a business man sufficiently well
to escape detection. But, if you approve
of the plan, I might pay him a visit at
his own house some evening, in company
with yourself, and be introduced as a fellow-passenger
of yours from India. I have
travelled in the East, so am equal to the
occasion. Only give me half-an-hour in
which to observe him at my leisure in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
own home, and I shall be able to satisfy
you if your surmises are correct or not.’</p>

<p>‘Very good,’ replied Captain Hindes.
‘What evening will suit you, doctor?’</p>

<p>‘I can go to-night, if you are sure
your brother will be at home.’</p>

<p>‘I will wire to my sister-in-law, and let
you know the result at once.’</p>

<p>‘Very well, sir. I will hold the time
at your disposal for, say, the next hour.’</p>

<p>Arthur thanked him, and withdrew to the
nearest telegraph office, whence he sent a
wire to Hannah, waiting there till he had
received her reply. It was satisfactory.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘We shall be at home this evening, and
glad to see you.’</p>
</div>

<p>With this, Arthur hastened back to
Doctor Govan, and received his promise
to meet him at the entrance of The Old
Hall gates at eight o’clock that night.
They were both punctual, and walked up
the drive together. The servant admitted
them to the library, where his master and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
mistress usually spent their evenings, and
they found Hannah sitting at her needlework
by the lamplight, whilst her husband
lounged in a chair with a newspaper on
his knees, but apparently doing nothing.</p>

<p>‘Well, Hal!’ exclaimed Arthur, cheerfully,
after he had saluted his sister-in-law,
‘how are you? I should have looked you
up before this, but I have been occupied
half the day with a friend and fellow-passenger
of mine, Doctor Govan. Let
me make you known to one another.
Doctor, this is my brother, Mr Hindes.’</p>

<p>As Hannah heard the profession of the
stranger mentioned, she threw a quick
glance towards Henry, to see how he
would take it, but seemingly he had forgotten
the breach of good manners of which
he had been guilty the night before, and recovered
his good temper, for he welcomed
both his brother and his friend heartily.</p>

<p>‘Delighted to see you both,’ he said.
‘Hannah, my dear, ring for brandy and
soda. My wife says I behaved like a
bear last night, Artie, in breaking up your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
party so soon; but I was confoundedly
sleepy, old chap, and that’s a fact, so you
must forgive me.’</p>

<p>‘Why, Hal, I don’t think you need
begin making excuses to me at this time
of day,’ replied his brother, who looked at
the doctor, nevertheless, to see how he took
this very brief mention of a great insult.</p>

<p>But Doctor Govan’s face was imperturbable,
and no index to his feelings. He
accepted a glass of brandy-and-soda, and
entered into a pleasant conversation with
Henry Hindes respecting his business and
shipping prospects, whilst Arthur maintained
small talk with Hannah. At last a
diversion was effected by the sound of a
child’s whimpering outside.</p>

<p>‘Wally being carried off to bed,’ said
his mother, smiling. ‘He is a very spoilt
boy, I am sorry to say, and it is seldom
effected without a controversy.’</p>

<p>‘Wally,’ cried his uncle. ‘Oh, do have
him in, Hannah! You forget I have not
been introduced to my nephew yet.’</p>

<p>‘It is so late,’ she said, demurringly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
as she glanced at the clock, ‘eight o’clock.
He ought to have been in bed half an
hour ago. And he may worry Doctor
Govan.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sure he won’t,’ replied Arthur, as
he sprang towards the door; ‘here, nurse,
bring that youngster this way. His mamma
wants him,’ he continued, and in another
minute the little fellow ran into the room
and hid his face in his mother’s lap.</p>

<p>It was evident how his father loved
him. Henry Hindes’s features lighted up
with paternal affection as his little son
appeared, and he called the child to him
and placed him on his knee, that all the
room might admire him. Master Wally
was really a splendid specimen of a boy,
notwithstanding his plainness, with his head
of thick, curly hair, his large, dark eyes,
and dimpled neck and shoulders showing
above his embroidered frock.</p>

<p>‘This is not a bad specimen to carry
on the family of the Hindes, eh, Arthur?’
inquired his father, proudly, as he passed
his hand over the infant’s curls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>‘He is a magnificent boy,’ said his
brother, enthusiastically, ‘and I don’t
wonder you are proud of him, Henry.
Why, he would make two of our little
Charlie! And how fat he is! He must
weigh about fifty pounds.’</p>

<p>‘And he is really very intelligent for
such a baby,’ interposed Hannah; ‘he
has taught himself all his letters from
his picture alphabet, and draws wonderfully
for so young a child.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ added Henry Hindes, proudly,
‘we are not at all ashamed of our son and
heir. We consider he is as good as most.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t remember ever to have seen
a finer child,’ said Doctor Govan, willing
to add his meed of admiration for
the parents’ pleasure, ‘but you must be
careful how you press so active a brain.
Never forget that the body and the brain
cannot grow together, unless at the expense
of one or the other. Let him do
nothing but play now! Half a dozen years
hence will be plenty of time to begin cramming
him. If the true history of most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
murderers could be traced back, it would
be found that their brains had been unduly
charged when young, and broken down, or
become abnormal under the process. You
don’t want this little man to develop into
a criminal, I’m sure,’ said the doctor, as he
kindly patted the boy’s shoulder.</p>

<p>But Henry Hindes’s manner had completely
changed. He snatched the child
from the stranger’s reach, and rose majestically
from his seat.</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’ he demanded,
‘by coupling my child’s name with that of a
murderer? Have you come here to insult
me? I will not let you touch him again.
I never heard of such a thing in my life!
Perhaps you are a murderer yourself, since
it comes so pat to you to talk of them.
Leave my house at once! I will not have
my children’s ears contaminated by hearing
of such things!’</p>

<p>‘Henry! Henry!’ pleaded his wife, ‘what
are you saying? This gentleman is our
guest—a friend of Arthur’s. You must not
speak to him like that! You can’t be well!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>‘Not well!’ he exclaimed vehemently,
‘that’s what you’re always cramming down
my throat nowadays. What is there about
me that is not well? I suppose you want
to get rid of me, and hope, by always dinning
the lie, that I’m not well, into my ears,
that you’ll frighten me into dying. But
you’re mistaken! I’ll live in spite of you!
And is this the reason,’ he continued,
turning fiercely upon Arthur, ‘that you
brought this man to my house? You
know I hate doctors. I told you yesterday
that I don’t believe in them. Why is he
here? Tell me the truth at once!’</p>

<p>‘There is nothing to tell, Henry,’ replied
his brother, in a tone of vexation, ‘except
that, since you choose to behave so unlike
a gentleman, it will be the last time my
friends ever intrude on you. I thought, in
bringing Doctor Govan to my brother’s
house, that I was ensuring him the treatment
due to his name and profession, but
I see I was mistaken. We will not stay
to be affronted any longer, so I will bid
you good-night.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>He was turning away, wounded and
unhappy, as he spoke, when a yell from
little Wally arrested his footsteps. Henry,
in his excitement, had dropped the child
heedlessly on the carpet, where it lay
screaming, whilst its father rubbed his
hand in a bewildered manner through his
hair. Hannah rushed to her baby and
picked it up.</p>

<p>‘That is always the way,’ she said, indignantly,
as she soothed the boy. ‘He
pretends to be so fond and proud of Wally,
and yet, at the slightest provocation, he
hurts or frightens him. That is why I did
not wish to have him down, Arthur,’ she
whispered to her brother-in-law; ‘I never
bring him in contact with his father, if I
can help it.’</p>

<p>‘I am so sorry. I did not know,’ said
Arthur, with a look of commiseration.
‘Come, Doctor Govan, I think we have
been here long enough.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, my object is effected,’ returned the
doctor, as he followed him out of the room.</p>

<p>Hannah ran off, at the same moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
with her child to the nursery, and Henry
Hindes was left standing in the library
alone. Captain Hindes did not speak
until they were clear of The Old Hall and
its surroundings, and then, as he and the
doctor were finding their way back to the
railway station, his tongue was loosed.</p>

<p>‘Well, doctor?’ he said, interrogatively,
‘I suppose, after what has happened, that
you have no doubt of the case.’</p>

<p>‘Not the slightest, my dear sir! Your
brother is no more mad than you are!’</p>

<p>Arthur turned round short, and regarded
him with astonishment.</p>

<p>‘Not mad?’ he ejaculated. ‘Then what
makes him behave in so extraordinary a
manner?’</p>

<p>‘That I cannot tell you. There may be
a dozen causes for it. I went there simply
to satisfy you with regard to danger to his
brain. Well, as far as I can see at present,
there is none! He has recourse to stimulant
of some sort or another. It may be
spirits, or it may be a narcotic, which has
shattered his nerves and weakened his control<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
over himself. But he is not mad; you
may rest assured of that; nor do I think
he will ever go mad. The brain is more
stupefied than excited.’</p>

<p>‘But what, then, makes him behave so
strangely? Doctor, if you will believe me,
my brother was one of the most pleasant-mannered
men about town. He was always
scrupulously well-dressed, and had all
the bearing and appearance of a courtier.
He was remarkable for it, being a business
man. Now, he is rude, uncertain and
slovenly. He seems to have lost his
memory, too, and his business habits are, I
am told, falling off. What can be the
reason?’</p>

<p>‘Drink, my dear sir—you will excuse
my saying so, for I am not at all prepared
to say that Mr Hindes takes more liquor
than is good for him—but stimulant in
any shape, be it alcohol or morphia, will
have all the effect you describe on a man.
May I ask if your brother has experienced
any great shock lately, that may account
for his having recourse to sedatives?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>‘Well! about nine or ten months ago,
his partner’s daughter was killed by a
fall, which so much affected her father
that he died also a few weeks afterwards.
Henry was a great friend of old Crampton’s,
and had known the girl from a child,
so he naturally felt their loss, so did his
wife, but hardly, I should imagine, to such
a degree as to make him take to intemperate
habits. Of course, it was a shock,
because it happened so suddenly; but our
father died of heart disease—was well one
hour, and dead the next—yet it did not
affect my brother in this terrible fashion.’</p>

<p>‘Has he had any trouble in business,
Captain Hindes—any monetary losses?’</p>

<p>‘I am sure not. On the contrary, when
Mr Crampton died, he left half his fortune,
a very large one, to that little chap we
saw this evening. I heard it was a stipulation
that the money was to accumulate
in the business till the boy comes of age.
I should say my brother was never so
well off, with regard to money, as he is at
the present moment.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>‘Well, of course these things are not
to be accounted for, unless one knows all
the inner workings of a man’s mind,
but that Mr Hindes is in the habit of
taking more morphia than is good for him,
I am certain. <i>Why</i> he takes it, opens
up a different question! He has a very
powerful brain, and, naturally, a well regulated
one, and it must have taken a large
quantity of drugs, or he has indulged in
them for a considerable time, to bring him
to his present condition. I have said he
is not mad, and I repeat my dictum, but
I do not say that, if he continues his habits
of taking morphia (or some other drug as
deadly in its effects), that he will not
reduce his brain to the level of madness,
or a condition equally deplorable.’</p>

<p>‘Good Heavens! how horrible!’ cried
Arthur.</p>

<p>‘You have sought my opinion, Captain
Hindes, and I have given you a faithful
one,’ said Doctor Govan, as they parted
at the station; ‘if you have your brother’s
welfare at heart, wean him, if possible, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
this most pernicious habit, otherwise he
will assuredly kill himself by it.’</p>

<p>Arthur Hindes returned to his hotel in
the lowest spirits. He had never kept a
secret from his wife, who was truly one
with him in every sense of the word, so
he told her all that had transpired between
him and the doctor, and asked her what
she would advise in the matter.</p>

<p>Edith thought for a moment, and then
replied,—</p>

<p>‘Since we have been talking about
going into the country, Artie, wouldn’t it
be better if we went to Switzerland, or
some mountainous district instead, and
persuaded Henry and Hannah to accompany
us? Away from London, and
living under your own eye, you would be
able to exert a better influence over him
than here. Perhaps, then, you might, as
the doctor said, wean your brother from
this dreadful habit. I am sure poor
Hannah is unhappy about it. The tears
were standing in her eyes several times
at the theatre last evening.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>‘How can she be otherwise than miserable
to see such a change in him? But
have you calculated, my darling, what
your proposal will entail on you? To
live in the same house, for months, perhaps,
with a man who may be as obnoxious to
you as a drunkard. For this craving for
morphia is very like drunkenness in its
effects. It renders a man irresponsible
for his actions, and may be the occasion
of many unpleasant scenes between us.
Am I justified in exposing you and the
children to such things?’</p>

<p>‘He is your only brother, Arthur, and
you love him. That is enough for me.
Were the consequences to be twice as
disagreeable, I would risk them for your
sake. Do what you think right in the
matter, and trust me to do all I can to
second your efforts.’</p>

<p>‘You’re the dearest wife a man ever
had,’ replied her husband, kissing her
pretty face, ‘and I thank you very much.
Your plan is an excellent one, if I can only
get Hal to accede to it. He will make all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
sorts of excuses about the business, of
course, but I will not leave him alone until
he consents to take a change. If it were
only for a few weeks, it would be better
than nothing.’</p>

<p>‘Artie, dear, take my advice and don’t
speak to Henry about it first. Go and see
Hannah. She is a sensible woman, and you
can tell her all the doctor said, and enlist
her on your side. She loves her husband—I
am sure of that—and will be delighted
to second any plan that is for his benefit.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, dear, you are right again. To
gain Hannah’s consent will be gaining
another ally. We shall be three against
one. Henry must yield to us then. I will
go over and speak to her to-morrow morning.
You have lifted a load off my mind,
Edith. I feel as if we must succeed now.’</p>

<p>Accordingly, the following morning, as
Hannah was sitting at home, with little
Wally playing at her feet, her brother-in-law
was announced. Her first thought
was to make some excuse for her husband’s
behaviour of the night before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, Arthur, I am glad to be able to
speak to you alone,’ she commenced. ‘It
shocked me that poor Henry was so
irritable last evening. Your friend must
have thought he was insane. But that is
the worst part about his illness. You can
never be certain of him for ten minutes
together. What did Doctor Govan think
of such an outburst? What did he say?’</p>

<p>‘He didn’t say much, Hannah. You
see, he is a medical man and used to such
things.’</p>

<p>‘But it made me feel so ashamed,’
continued the wife, with the suspicious
moisture in her eyes, ‘and I hope you will
not think me ungracious, Arthur, if I ask
you not to bring any more of your friends
here without giving us notice. Henry
had been irritable all the afternoon, and if
I had known a stranger was coming, I
should have coaxed him to go to bed
before you arrived.’</p>

<p>‘I am very glad you didn’t, Hannah, for
I am going to tell you a secret. Doctor
Govan is no friend of mine. I never set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
eyes on him till yesterday morning. I
brought him here expressly that he should
see Henry in his own home, and be able
to report on his health, without his being
aware he was examined by an expert.’</p>

<p>‘An expert!’ exclaimed Hannah, paling.
‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘A specialist, then, if you prefer the term—anyway,
a medical man who is at the top
of the tree.’</p>

<p>‘But why—why?’ she said, with a
startled gaze.</p>

<p>‘Because I felt very much alarmed about
his condition. His conduct at the theatre
the other night, joined to his altered manners
and appearance, all combined to make
me think that he must have had some shock
to addle his brain. Hannah, don’t be angry,
but Henry has behaved to me, ever since I
came home, like nothing short of a madman,
and it made me very uneasy about him.’</p>

<p>‘And was—this—this gentleman a mad
doctor, and did you bring him here to examine
my husband?’ she inquired with
surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>‘He was; and I certainly brought him
here that he might give me a truthful report
on Henry’s condition,’ replied Captain
Hindes.</p>

<p>‘How dared you?—how dared you?’
she panted.</p>

<p>‘Why, Hannah, I never thought you
would take it like this! I consider that
you have somewhat neglected your duty,
in not having called in a doctor to him
long ago. I think my brother is in a very
critical state. Doctor Govan does not, I
am glad to say, consider him mad, but he
says he will drive himself so if he is not
carefully watched in the future. He pronounces
him to be suffering from the effects
of opium, or some other narcotic, and that
he has weakened his brain by its use,
and is hardly responsible for his actions.
Henry is my brother, you must remember,
Hannah, as well as your husband, and it is
my duty to look after him. Doctor Govan
says that, if we cannot wean him from the
habit he has fallen into, he will inevitably
kill himself by it. Now, Edith and I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
been talking the matter over, and came to
the conclusion that we must all act in concert.
I am willing to take my wife and
family to Switzerland, or any distant place
we may agree upon, if you and Henry will
join us there, so that I may have him
under my own eye, and do my best to
restore him to health. You will do your
part, I am sure, Hannah, and persuade your
husband to consent to this arrangement.’</p>

<p>‘<i>I will not!</i>’ replied Hannah, with
closed lips.</p>

</div>


<p>Arthur looked at her in amazement.
Was this his gentle sister-in-law? Her
very voice seemed changed, and her frame
was shaking with her unusual emotion.</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’ he asked. ‘Surely
you have Henry’s welfare at heart as much
as we have.’</p>

<p>‘I think I have, Arthur; but I will not
attempt to persuade him to go to Switzerland,
or any other place, unless it should
be alone with me. I have already told
you that he cannot bear the noise of
children, even that of his own, neither
does he care for company. I was sorry
and surprised that, knowing his state of
health, you should have introduced a
stranger at The Old Hall without giving
us notice, but now that I find he was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
mad doctor, brought here to examine my
husband without my leave or cognisance,
I think it little short of an insult.’</p>

<p>‘An insult? Oh! Hannah! that is too
hard a word,’ interposed her brother-in-law.</p>

<p>‘I don’t say you meant it so, but at the
least it was a piece of great officiousness on
your part. How dared you think, or let
others think,’ she went on, suddenly flaring
up, ‘that my husband—is <i>mad</i>? Is that
brotherly solicitude? For shame! For
shame! Had I known who your <i>friend</i>
was, I would have turned him from my
door.’</p>

<p>‘Then there is no chance, I suppose,’
said Arthur, sorrowfully, ‘of persuading
you to join your forces to ours, and inducing
Henry to go away with us for a
change?’</p>

<p>‘Not the slightest. He does not need
change. If he does, we will go away
quietly together. Don’t think me unkind,
Arthur, but I have already told you what
Henry’s illness arises from. I know he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
sometimes takes a little dose of morphia,
or smokes a pipe of opium; he does it
to allay the pain of neuralgia, which often
unfits him for business; many other
neuralgic patients do the same. The pain
he endures unfits him for society also;
it upsets his nerves and makes him irritable.
But to call him mad—to bring a
mad doctor to see him, without asking his
consent, or mine— Oh! it was cruel—cruel!’</p>

<p>She turned her back upon her brother-in-law,
and went on with her work, whilst
he sat there, hardly knowing what to do
or say.</p>

<p>‘How am I to persuade you, Hannah,’
he resumed at last, ‘that I acted in all
love and kindness towards my brother and
you? I believed that, living always by his
side, you could not have noticed what is
so very palpable to me—the extraordinary
change in poor Henry—’</p>

<p>‘Not seen it?’ she interrupted him with.
‘Not wept over it, and prayed over it for
months past! Why not say at once that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
I do not love my husband, Arthur? I
know far more of him than you do, and
could have saved you the trouble of bringing
a <i>mad</i> doctor to gloat upon his infirmities.
Henry is unhappy, poor darling!
He has been unhappy ever since his
partner’s death, and his nerves have
become unstrung. He is foolish, perhaps,
to take so much morphia, but it soothes
and relieves him, and anything is better
than that he should suffer. But you will
not cure him—neither you nor your
doctors! Only time and affection will
do that, with perfect quiet. I will not,
therefore, have him disturbed, nor worried
in any way, either by relations or
strangers. I will not let him go to
public amusements again, which only tire
him, but he shall stay at home with
me till God, in His own good time, sees
fit to cure him of his complaint.’</p>

<p>‘Forgive me, Hannah,’ said Captain
Hindes, after a pause, ‘I daresay I have
been very officious, but I did it for the
best. Won’t you believe that?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, I believe that.’</p>

<p>‘And I will leave Henry for the future
to you. But, oh! do try to wean him
from that dreadful habit. And look
here, my dear, under these circumstances,
what is the use of my remaining in
London? I cannot afford the expense
of an hotel, and came here, as you must
know, only to be near you and Henry.
But it can be no pleasure to me to continue
to see him in this condition, especially
if I can do him no good. It unnerves
me, Hannah. He is a wreck of his former
self. We shall only quarrel if we continue
to meet, so the sooner I take my wife and
little ones into the fresh country, the better.
Don’t be surprised, then, if we start almost
immediately, but I shall, of course, run up
and say good-bye to you and Henry before
we go.’</p>

<p>He held out his hand to her as he spoke,
but, to his surprise, instead of taking it,
Hannah covered her face with her own,
and burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>‘Oh! it is so hard—so hard,’ she sobbed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
‘to see him so unlike himself, and find no
remedy on any side. I would—I would,’
she continued hysterically, ‘give my life to
see him as he used to be. But it is in vain
wishing for it—all in vain—in vain!’</p>

<p>Arthur sat down beside her again, and
took her hand.</p>

<p>‘My dear Hannah,’ he said, ‘I feel sure
that all the dear old man wants is a complete
change. He has been brooding over
these sad deaths of the Cramptons, and that,
added to business matters being a great
anxiety, and this confounded neuralgia driving
him half crazy, has had a great effect
upon his mind. But, if he went right away,
it would work a miracle for him. Come,
dear girl, think over my proposal a second
time, and bring him to Switzerland, with
Edie and me.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, no; anything but that,’ said
Hannah, shaking her head. ‘I will pray
for him, and strive for him at home, but
he must not go into society. Oh, Arthur,
cease worrying me about it! I am so
miserable—so miserable.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>‘My poor sister, I can see you are.
Well, as you say, we must trust him to
God. Good-bye for the present. Edie
shall give you proper notice of our next
visit. But this isn’t as it used to be—eh,
Hannah?’</p>

<p>‘No; nothing is as it used to be,’ she
responded, as she wished him farewell.</p>

<p>As soon as her brother-in-law was out of
sight and hearing, poor Hannah gave vent
to her tears in right earnest. How was all
this to end, she thought. What would become
of her hapless husband if it went on
much longer? His condition had already
attracted public notice. The next thing
would be that he was declared unfit to conduct
his business, and their affairs would
have to be handed over to the care of
a stranger. She foresaw nothing in the
future but misery for herself and her children.
She saw no prospect of ever having
her daughters to live at home, for every day
strengthened her resolve not to bring them
in contact with so depraved and uncertain
a father. Nothing remained for her but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
life of servitude and loneliness, while she
pandered to a sin she abhorred for the sake
of the children she loved. Even so innocent
a pleasure as the society of her brother
and sister-in-law was denied her. Henry’s
conduct had estranged them. Little by
little, she foresaw she would be called upon
to relinquish everything that had made her
existence pleasant to her.</p>

<p>When her husband returned home and
she communicated the fact of his brother’s
proposed departure to him, he became
as angry as if he had been doing everything
in his power to make their stay
in town agreeable. He called Arthur
ungrateful, and Edith a fool, and wanted
to know why they had ever returned
to England if they intended to spend
their furlough apart from the only relations
they had in the world.</p>

<p>‘I think you forget, Henry,’ interposed
his wife, ‘that Arthur is not very
rich, and to live in London with five
children is rather expensive work. Their
weekly bills must amount to something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
terrific. I don’t wonder at his being
anxious to get them all off into the
country. He talks of going to Switzerland.’</p>

<p>‘Switzerland! Bosh!’ exclaimed Henry
Hindes. ‘Why don’t he bring the lot of
them to The Old Hall? There’s plenty
of room for them here! I should like
to see the children running about! The
place has been infernally dull since you
sent the girls away. Just write and tell
Arthur that the old place is at his disposal
whenever he likes. Why didn’t
they come here from the beginning?
What was the obstacle?’</p>

<p>‘<i>You</i> were, Henry!’ said Hannah,
looking at him steadily. ‘Have you
forgotten that already?’</p>

<p>The man shivered, and turned away.
But, the next moment, he was braving it
out.</p>

<p>‘<i>You</i> were, you mean, confound you!’
he retorted. ‘But if I choose to have my
brother here, I shall do so without asking
your leave, and that I tell you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>‘I don’t think he would care to accept
your invitation now,’ she said, ‘for you
have behaved so rudely to him—once at
the theatre and yesterday, when his friend
was present,—that he would, I fancy, be
rather afraid of subjecting himself to
the daily risk of renewing such scenes.
Arthur told me this afternoon that—’</p>

<p>‘What?—what?’ cried Hindes, quickly,
‘what did he tell you? He doesn’t suspect,
does he, Hannah—he doesn’t think—you
haven’t <i>told</i> him,’ he continued,
grasping her arm as if he held it in a
vice. ‘You haven’t betrayed me—speak,
speak, for God’s sake! Don’t keep me
in suspense!’</p>

<p>He looked so abject as he put the question
with trembling eagerness, that her
heart went out to him with a great burst
of pity. He was a murderer—but she
loved him.</p>

<p>‘No, no, darling!’ she replied, with unwonted
tenderness, as she bent down and
kissed his haggard face, ‘how can you
think so for a moment? I shall never,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
never betray you, Harry; not even at the
bar of Heaven. If I am brought up there
as witness against you, I will go to hell
sooner than open my mouth. Don’t think
it of me! You are not safer with God
Himself than you are with me, my poor
Harry!’</p>

<p>‘I know it, I know it!’ he muttered;
‘but why can’t Arthur come here, then?’</p>

<p>‘Because—oh! there are many reasons;
don’t make me reiterate them. But one is,
that I am afraid your conduct would excite
his attention and, perhaps, his suspicions.
You are not master of yourself,
Henry! That dreadful morphia makes
you just the same as if you were intoxicated.
It is killing you, body and soul.
You take far too much of it. You must
give it up. Oh! do promise me, Hal, to
try and do without it. Half your time you
are so stupid, you don’t know what you are
saying or doing. Even the servants see
the alteration in you. <i>Do</i> give it up,
Henry. I would ask it of you on my
bended knees if I thought it would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
any effect. Promise me you will throw
the horrid bottle away, and never take any
more of it.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot, I cannot!’ he replied in a
despairing whisper. ‘I take it to keep <i>her</i>
away. Directly I leave it off for a night
<i>she</i> comes and reproaches me with—you
know what—and I cannot bear her
eyes, they drive me mad.’</p>

<p>‘Dear husband, it is only your fancy.
She is far too happy, by this time, not
to have forgotten and forgiven long ago.
Only pray for God’s forgiveness and all
will be right. Or come away with me, as
you proposed once before, and let us try to
be at peace with our children again, in a
new land.’</p>

<p>‘Not now,’ he said, shaking his head,
‘not while Arthur is in England. He
would suspect—he would come too. Wait!—wait,
till he is gone away again.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! Harry, never mind him. He may
not go back to India for years. And your
health is getting worse and worse. New
scenes and interests would drive these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
feverish fancies out of your head. What
is anything worth, in comparison to that?
Leave the business to take care of itself!
Sell it for anything it may fetch; only come
away from England, and let me try to help
you to overcome the dreadful habit you
have contracted.’</p>

<p>‘It is too late, my dear. I could not do
without it now. I should go mad.’</p>

<p>‘Henry, you <i>will</i> go mad if you do not
leave it off! That Doctor Govan, who
came here last evening, detected your
fondness for morphia at once, and he told
Arthur—’</p>

<p>But the idea that he was watched, raised
the devil in Henry Hindes at once.</p>

<p>‘How <i>dare</i> Arthur set traps to catch
me!’ he exclaimed furiously, ‘and you are
aiding and abetting him. <i>Who</i> told you
what the doctor said? When have you
seen my brother since? Are you all in
league against me?’</p>

<p>‘No! no! Henry; don’t be so foolish,’
replied his wife. ‘No one says or thinks
anything except for your good. But your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
brother is anxious on your account. Anyone
would be who had known you in
former days. You cannot know how ill
you look. And so he brought his friend
to see you, hoping he might suggest a
remedy. But Doctor Govan said nothing
will do you any good until you leave off
morphia.’</p>

<p>‘D—n his impudence!’ exclaimed
Hindes, angrily; ‘that’s what he was
sneaking round here for, was it? I’ll teach
him to lay siege to me in my own house.
The next time he shows his face here, I’ll
kick him out, and Arthur into the bargain.
But it’s all your fault,’ he continued, turning
round upon her. ‘If you didn’t go
about with that long face of yours, people
wouldn’t be trying to find out what was
the matter with me. Sending the children
away from home, too; why, that in itself is
enough to raise any one’s suspicion—you,
who always advocated home education,
especially for girls. It is abominable—infamous—that
a man cannot have any
dependence even on his wife!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>The injustice of this attack, coming so
immediately upon her kindness to him,
stirred all the resentment of which she was
capable in Hannah’s breast.</p>

<p>‘You are unjust to me,’ she cried,
‘most unjust! What other woman would
have done for you what I have done?
What other woman would have stayed
by your side, after she knew what <i>I</i>
know? I sent the girls away because
I felt it was impossible they should be
brought up in the same house with you,
and the sequel has proved I was right.
If any suspicions have been aroused, it
is by your own conduct. The fatal
habit you have contracted is as bad as
that of drinking. It deprives a man of
all self-respect—all forethought—all control
over himself, or his temper. The
scenes which took place in the theatre,
and here, last night, are horrible to me
and degrading to yourself. I have
offered to exile myself with you in order
to help you fight against the demon that
possesses you, and you have refused. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
can do no more. Henceforward, you
must go your own way, without aid
from me! I can only wait and watch
for the end.’</p>

<p>She turned from him indignantly as
she concluded, and Henry Hindes felt
for the first time as if he were indeed
deserted by God and man.</p>

<p>The idea rendered him frantic. He
dashed out of the room and stumbled
upstairs. At the top he met little
Wally coming to bid papa and mamma
good-night, carefully feeling his way down
the broad stairs by holding on tight to
the banisters. Master Wally was, as his
nurse said, ‘quite a man.’ He highly objected
to being led, or held by the hand.
‘Let Wally go, all by his self,’ he would
say, and so, clad in his white frock and
blue ribbons, he was laboriously making
his way downwards, whilst his nurse
followed, smiling proudly at his independence.</p>

<p>Just as he had commenced to descend
the last flight, he encountered his father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
mad with rage and fear and morphia. He
did not even seem to see the little figure
he so dearly loved, as he stumbled upstairs,
and half fell, half brushed rudely
against it. The baby lost his slight hold
of the railings at once, and fell to the very
bottom, where he lay motionless.</p>

<p>A shriek from the nurse brought
Hannah quickly out of the library, when
she found her little son lying on the mat
in the hall. As she raised him, she
glanced upwards and saw her husband
standing at the head of the staircase, paralysed
with fright. She had only time to
ask, ‘Is this <i>your</i> doing?’ when he threw
his arms wildly above his head, and exclaiming,
‘The cliffs! the cliffs! A judgment!
a judgment!’ rushed away and
locked himself into his own room.</p>

<p>Hannah had no care, at that moment,
but for her little child. The nurse was
sobbingly informing her how the dear
baby was coming downstairs so beautifully,
and how the master fell against him and
upset his balance, and she hoped her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
mistress wouldn’t fancy it was by any
fault of hers, when Hannah interrupted
her by saying,—</p>

<p>‘Go and tell James to fetch Doctor
Sewell at once, Annie, and I will lay
Wally on the library sofa.’</p>

<p>She carried her little son away as she
spoke, and sat down with him in her arms.
Wally had not yet given any signs of
consciousness, but lay like a bruised lily
on his mother’s lap. His face was very
white, and his eyes were closed, but there
was no appearance of his having sustained
any injury. But when Dr Sewell arrived,
he looked very serious over the misadventure.
He measured the height of the
fall, and examined the child’s head and
temples carefully. Then he said, as Wally
stirred and moaned, and gave signs of
returning consciousness,—</p>

<p>‘You had better put the little fellow to
bed, Mrs Hindes, and let his nurse sit up
with him during the night. I will send
a draught for him to take, and will be here
early to-morrow.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>‘But, doctor,’ said Hannah, anxiously,
‘you don’t think this fall will have any
bad effects, do you? He has so often
tumbled about before.’</p>

<p>‘Of course, of course,’ replied the doctor,
cheerfully, ‘and will do so again, no doubt,
but there is no harm in taking a little
precaution. He is getting a heavy boy
now, you know, and a fall is, consequently,
more risky. But, doubtless, he will be all
right after a few days’ rest. Get him to
bed, and don’t take him out again till I
have seen him in the morning.’</p>

<p>He left her with this sorry bit of comfort,
and she carried her little boy up to
her own bed, and prepared to watch by
him for the night herself. As long as the
nurse attended on her and Wally, she was
undisturbed, but when she had dismissed
her, and all the house was quiet, she heard
the door between her room and that of
her husband softly unclose, and Henry
Hindes’s haggard face appeared in the
opening. Hannah felt so much disgust
for him at that moment, that she could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
help showing the feeling in her face and
manner.</p>

<p>‘Oh, go away, go away!’ she exclaimed
with averted eyes, ‘I can’t bear to see you
or hear your voice. You have done
enough mischief, God knows! Go away
and leave me in peace with my child. It
is the least thing you can do.’</p>

<p>‘Is he dead?’ demanded Hindes, in an
awed whisper.</p>

<p>‘He is not; but it is not your fault that
he still lives. And what terrible results
may follow this unnatural fall, no one
knows. I told you what your habits
would lead to. You have the consolation
of knowing that you have injured, and
perhaps killed, your favourite child by your
fatal indulgence.’</p>

<p>‘No! not killed—not <i>killed</i>—’ he repeated
hoarsely, ‘it is impossible. God
cannot have so little mercy.’</p>

<p>‘Mercy!’ cried Hannah, shrilly, for the
accident to her baby had dried up, for the
time being, every drop of the milk of human
kindness in her, ‘what mercy have you a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
right to expect at His hand—<i>you</i>, who
showed none? You are not satisfied with
making <i>one</i> mother childless. You must
try and take the only joy left in my
wretched life from me. You deprived me
of the society of my girls, and now you
want to murder my boy.’</p>

<p>She had used the word inadvertently,
but it stabbed the unfortunate man before
her to the heart. He glared wildly at her
for a minute, and then, with a low cry like
the protest of a wounded animal, he
slammed the door between them, and
locked it on the other side. Hannah had
a bolt on hers, and she rose at once and
drew it. She felt she could not endure
his presence again that night. So she sat
by Wally’s side, and watched his feverish
slumbers alone till daylight.</p>

</div>


<p>Doctor Sewell’s report, the next morning,
was not entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p>It was true that Wally was quite conscious,
and had eaten a good breakfast, but
he cried when he was moved, and did not
seem to wish to get up, which was so far
fortunate, because the medical man strictly
forbade his doing so. But it made Hannah
very uneasy, since it plainly denoted that
he had sustained more injury than was
outwardly apparent.</p>

<p>She did not see her husband all the day,
during which he kept strictly to his own
room, and she was glad of it, for she felt
that she could not have spoken to him as
she ought. She was already ashamed of her
outburst of the day before, but did not feel
as if she could speak much differently even
now. For, as she sat by Wally’s side, trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
to soothe his fretfulness under pain,
her thoughts would revert to sweet, beautiful
Jenny, struck down through the same
hand. Was this really a judgment on her
husband for his unconfessed crime? Was
<i>his</i> child to be taken from him, in the same
way and by the same hand that had made
other parents, as loving as himself, childless?
But it was hard on her—very, very
hard, that she should suffer, through her
little son, for his father’s sins. Hannah
sat by the baby’s side, thinking these sad
thoughts throughout the day, and when
night fell, and Wally was asleep, she
wrestled with Heaven in prayer that the
cup might pass away from her. Yet she
knew, even while she prayed, that it is part
of the world’s plan that the innocent shall
suffer for the guilty, and often more than
they suffer themselves.</p>

<p>When the household was once more
sunk in sleep, Hannah bethought her of
her husband, of whom she had heard
nothing since the previous night. What
was he doing? Whom had he spoken to?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
What had he had to eat? She felt she
must ascertain these points before she
went to rest herself, for the doctor had
told her, since the boy was out of immediate
danger, it must be days, perhaps weeks,
before he could finally pronounce on the
ultimate effects of the accident, and therefore
it behoved her not to try her strength
more than was absolutely needful. With
the purpose of seeing her husband, she
tried the door between them, but found it
was still locked on his side, therefore she
went round to that which opened into the
passage, which he had left unfastened, and
went softly in. The sight which met her
eyes was a pitiable one. Henry Hindes
was on his knees beside the bed, moaning
in the agony of his spirit. Yet, such is the
force of a mother’s love, that the expression
of his pain did not move her as it had done
that evening in the library. For since then
had he not injured <i>her</i> child, which had
awakened a twofold repulsion in her breast
against him; one for herself and the other
for Mrs Crampton. Hannah had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
realised till now what <i>her</i> agony of loss
had been. As she approached him, Hindes
lifted his bloodshot eyes and muttered,—</p>

<p>‘Say it at once, for God’s sake! Is he
gone?’</p>

<p>‘Wally? No!’</p>

<p>‘Thank Heaven!’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be too quick to do that, Henry.
He is in pain. There is no knowing what
injuries he may not have sustained.
Dr Sewell will give no opinion. He says
time only can show; pray that God may
have mercy upon us, and not visit your
sins on the head of your unoffending child.’</p>

<p>Hindes groaned.</p>

<p>‘What would the worst be—the worst
that could happen to him?’</p>

<p>‘Spinal disease. A cripple for life, or
a lingering death,’ replied Hannah, sternly.</p>

<p>She could not find it in her heart to
lighten the blow to the author of it.</p>

<p>‘A cripple for life—a lingering death—my
Wally, my darling Wally!’ sobbed
the father. ‘Oh, Hannah, my punishment
is heavier than I can bear.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>‘You will <i>have to</i> bear it, if God wills;
so shall I—as the Cramptons had to
bear—’</p>

<p>‘No, no, Hannah, for Heaven’s sake,
no!’ screamed Henry Hindes, as he
cowered beside the bedclothes. ‘I have
seen his face—Mr Crampton’s face—before
me ever since, saying, “<i>Now</i> you will
know! <i>Now</i> you will know!” I drugged
myself with morphia last night, but it was
no good. He was there all the time—all
the time.’</p>

<p>‘This is your fancy, Henry. I have
told you so before. It is your own
thoughts that take bodily shape to haunt
you. But this sad accident calls loudly
for reparation and repentance. Confess
your sins to God, Henry. Ask Him to
forgive them—tell Him everything—your
unhallowed wishes and desires, your
hasty temper and revenge, your disregard
of advice and entreaty. He knows all
your weakness, and will have compassion
on it, and, perhaps, for the sake of your
penitence and desire of amendment, He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
may mercifully spare our little one, and
avert the possible consequences of your
muddled senses.’</p>

<p>‘I <i>will</i> pray, I <i>will</i> repent,’ moaned the
unhappy man, with his face still hidden,
‘and I will confess, Hannah, everything—everything—if
God will only hear and
forgive me.’</p>

<p>‘He is sure to do that,’ said Hannah,
more kindly; ‘though it is impossible to
say in what way He may answer your
prayers. But we will both pray, Henry,
will we not, that this miserable affair may
leave no bad effects behind it? And, should
our prayers be granted, you will promise
me to give up taking morphia, for the
future, and keep your brain clear for the
duties of everyday life. This would
never have happened, remember, except
that you were too stupefied, to see the
child’s danger, or that you were in his
way.’</p>

<p>‘I know, I know,’ he answered, ‘but he
is better to-night, is he not?’</p>

<p>‘There is no knowing—Doctor Sewell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
says it is impossible to say,’ she said,
as she turned and left him to his own
reflections.</p>

<p>Many more days passed in this miserable
uncertainty. Doctor Sewell brought
two more doctors with him, to make a
thorough examination of the little child,
but, though they all agreed that the spine
had been injured, they could not decide
to what extent. All they could say was,
that Wally must be kept on his back till
the real extent of the mischief was ascertained.
It might be months, even years,
before the matter was finally decided;
meanwhile, he must be kept perfectly still
while indoors, and only taken out in the
air, lying flat on his back, in a wheeled
chair. It was a pleasant prospect to have
to keep a sturdy child of Wally’s age
amused from morn to night, whilst in a
recumbent position; but it was the only
chance for him, so it must be done. The
poor mother sat down patiently to await
the verdict, but Henry Hindes raved like
a madman at the doctors’ orders, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
declared he should shoot himself before
the best or worst was made known to him.
Hannah insisted that he should return to
his duties, and leave her to the melancholy
charge of looking after the child.</p>

<p>‘You are worse than useless here,
Henry. In fact, your presence and loud
lamentations over him disturb Wally, and
make him fretful and restless. Besides,
you have your own duties to attend to, and
must neglect them no longer. If you are
sincere in your sorrow over this accident,
prove it by doing your duty like a man,
and attending the office as usual.’</p>

<p>For Henry Hindes had shut himself up
since the night he had thrown his child
down the stairs, and refused to meet
anybody, on business or otherwise. Mr
Abercorn, the chief clerk, and Mr Bloxam,
the cashier, had been up to Hampstead
together to inquire the reason of their
employer’s non-appearance in the city, and
Mrs Hindes had been obliged to tell them
that her husband was confined to his room
and quite unfit to see them, or attend to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
business for the present. She was obliged
to invent this fiction, for the reason that,
for some days, Hindes was imbibing opium
to such an extent, and raving of what
distressed his conscience so freely, that
she felt, at all hazards, she must keep
everybody from him but herself.</p>

<p>Captain Hindes and his wife came over,
as soon as they heard of poor Hannah’s
fresh trouble, and would have done anything
in their power to help her, but it was
a case where the assistance of one’s fellow-creatures
could avail nothing, and the only
thing was to wait and hope. Arthur did
not see his brother on the occasion, for
Henry had shut himself up in his own room,
as usual, and refused to open the door.
He had come chiefly to tell Hannah that
they had found a little cottage to suit them
in the Isle of Wight, and intended moving
into it at once. She was not sorry to hear
their news. She longed to get them, and
everybody connected with her husband, out
of the way, so that she might have him to
herself, and shield him from all prying eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
and ears. During his short period of
seclusion, she had carried all his meals to
his room with her own hands, and coaxed
him to eat them by every means in her
power. And, now that the first shock was
over, she ordered him to return to his
official duties as she would have ordered a
boy to return to school. He had reduced
himself to such a state that he was no longer
capable of regulating his actions. His reappearance
in the office was so far beneficial
that a business never proceeds so well
and regularly as when the head of it is
absent; but Hindes had almost rendered
himself incapable, by this time, of taking any
active part in the management of affairs,
which he left entirely to his two chief men,
Abercorn and Bloxam, whilst he sat brooding
in his private room, or wandered restlessly
about the streets, waiting for the
doctors’ verdict respecting Wally, and
wondering how much longer they would
keep him in suspense. He consulted the
best known physicians about the child, and
brought the cleverest surgeons to see him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
but the answer of each one was the same,
‘Wait, wait! This is a case for time. No
one can foretell the upshot of such a fall
until the child has, in a measure, done
growing.’</p>

<p><i>Done growing!</i> And Wally was not yet
three years old. Henry Hindes would
groan within himself, and say that it was
impossible. He could not be kept so long
in suspense. He must know at once. He
almost felt sometimes as if he would rather
his boy had been killed outright, than condemned
to such a lingering illness as this
promised to be. He could not bear it!
He could not! He could not!</p>

<p>During those days of mortification and
miserable impatience, how more than
vividly Jenny Crampton’s fair image returned
to his memory to torture him. His
wife had advised him to confess all his unhallowed
desires and wishes regarding her,
but even Hannah knew little of what he
had hoped, in his maddest moments, regarding
Jenny. She had been a flirt—no doubt
of that, though her errant heart had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
caught fast at last by Frederick Walcheren.
But before those days, when Henry Hindes
had had no reason to affront her by the expression
of his jealousy, she had not disdained
to flirt a little with him on her own
account.</p>

<p>She had meant her expressions of
regard for him as nothing but a flash of
coquetry; but he, with his secret passion
for the beautiful girl, and the mad dreams
he sometimes indulged in concerning her,
had chosen to translate her kindness in
a far warmer manner than she intended
he should. And these tender moments,
which were seared upon his memory,
came back with irritating persistency to
him now that they were over for ever—that
even the remembrance of them had
been dispelled by the terrible knowledge
that his hand had quenched them for ever!</p>

<p>One day that he had brought her a
little souvenir for her birthday—merely
an <i>étui</i> of velvet, filled with scissors and
thimble, and the rest of the rubbish provided
for the work of ladies who <i>don’t</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
work, mounted in gold, and encrusted
with turquoises—Jenny had kissed him—had
advanced her ripe, pouting lips of
her own accord, and pressed them upon
his. He could recall to this day how
the piece of coquetry affected him. She
had guessed, well enough, her power over
this apparently staid, sensible man of
business, and liked to show it. She had
smiled on him the while in her saucy
way and made his head swim. It was
this circumstance, and one or two others
like it, that had caused Jenny to turn
against him and say hard things about
him directly she had gained a lover whose
heart she wished to keep. It was the
remembrance of such things that had
made her fear the expression of his
jealousy, and declare he took an unwarrantable
interest in her affairs.</p>

<p>Yet, the feeling her kiss had raised in
his breast haunted the wretched man
long after he had caused her death.
Sometimes the one memory pained him
more than the other. He would wonder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
if he had been bold enough to speak
openly to Jenny of his feelings regarding
her, whether she would have listened to
his story and requited his affection, just
a little, in return. She would dance
before him, like an airy phantom, all
through the dull, old streets of the city,
beckoning him, with her dimpled little
hand, to come nearer and nearer, and
taste her lips once more! And then,
when he had worked his imagination up
to a pitch of frenzy, the scene would
change, and he would see, instead, Jenny
lying still and white in her shroud, with
the purple marks of foul decomposition
upon her cheeks and brow. Yet, dead as
she appeared, her wraith would still have
the power to unclose its lustreless eyes
and livid lips to say, ‘<i>These</i> are the lips
with which I kissed you, and <i>you</i> it was
who rendered them like this, unfit for
anyone but the worms to touch again.’</p>

<p>He would see her in the sunshine, and
in the gloaming—in the crowded streets
and by the deserted river-side—in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
Mart and in his private office—till he
nearly went mad with the longing to
stamp her out from his brain, or to plunge
himself into the silent river and follow
her wherever she might be.</p>

<p>Much as she had haunted and pursued
him since that fatal moment when he pushed
her over the Dover cliff, never had he seen
her as he had done since Wally’s accident!
She seemed to come now with a mocking
smile upon her lips—a smile which said,
‘<i>I</i> did it! <i>I</i> made him fall! <i>I</i> did for you
what you did for me! Who was it made
you drink morphia until you had paralysed
your brain? <i>I!</i> Who was it drove you
wild as you stumbled up these stairs? The
remembrance of <i>me</i>! You killed me, and
I have subjected your boy to a living death—a
death far worse than mine—a death
which will numb his nerves and his brain,
and keep him a prisoner for life, tied to a
sofa, inert in mind and muscle. Wally’s
accident was due to me! <i>You</i> made my
parents childless. I have robbed you of
your son and heir.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>He suffered extra torture from the daily
inquiries which met him as he entered the
office. Of course, every clerk there had
heard the story of his child’s fall, and was
anxious to learn what the effects might be.
The constant question of, ‘How is the little
boy to-day, sir? I trust he is better;’
or, ‘Have the doctors given any decided
opinion about Master Wally, sir? Is he
any worse this morning?’ drove the unfortunate
father nearly out of his senses, and
often caused him to swear, in a most unfatherly
manner, in return for the kindly
inquiries made on the child’s behalf.</p>

<p>He could not banish the thought, even
for a moment. His brother had migrated
to the Isle of Wight, and he never saw his
wife, except by Wally’s bedside. The boy,
too, who had been so strong and sturdy
was fast being reduced, under the effect of
inertion and confinement, to a thin and
sickly-looking child. His hands, that used
to be so chubby, had grown white and
limp; his abundant hair had been cropped
to make him more comfortable, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
temper was fractious and irritable. In fact,
he was no longer the little Wally of whom
he had been so proud. He was almost as
much changed, for the worse, as Henry
Hindes himself. Sometimes, as his father
sighed the long days away, Hannah’s admonition
would recur to his mind: ‘Confess
your sins to God, Henry! Tell Him
everything! He knows your weakness and
will have compassion on it!’</p>

<p>But where should he confess? To whom
could he pour out the tale of his sins and
his follies? He could not trust a private
person, and the parsons of the Protestant
church, though they professed to hear the
confessions of the dying, who were passing
into the very Presence of the great Father-Confessor
of us all, and had no need of any
more ministrations of man, would not hear
a word from the living and the strong, who
were still battling with the difficulties of
life. He recalled what Mr Bloxam had
told him one day, not so long before, of the
consolation Catholics found in confession,
and how it relieved their souls and consciences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
to receive absolution from their
priests. Hindes wondered how they set
about it, whether it was a difficult task, or
easily accomplished. In the course of the
long walks he frequently took round the
City, when his conscience would not let him
sit still in the office any longer, he had often
come across a little Roman Catholic church,
in the East-end of London, where the congregation
seemed of a poorer class than the
generality. One afternoon he had peeped
inside it, and looked, with wonder, at the
brass ornaments and artificial flowers on
the altar, at the dimly-lighted swinging
lamp before the Virgin’s shrine, at the
confessional on either side the building,
covered in dingy red cloth, with the name
of the priest, who occupied it, in white
letters over the portal.</p>

<p>Henry Hindes had tried to confess his
sins to God. He had poured out his soul
in prayer, as well as he knew how, but the
words had sounded hollow and meaningless
in his own ears. He did not know
God. He had never been used to talk to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
Him, and now that he had so great necessity
of His reply, he did not know how to
address Him. True, he had been a constant
attendant at church, but the service
had been a mockery to him. He had
never really prayed from his heart. And
now his prayers seemed to come back
upon himself, unanswered, as if he had
uttered them to the empty air. Wally
grew no better for them. He still lay
in his mother’s bed, weary, languid and
fretful. God had certainly not yet seen
fit to answer any prayers on his behalf.
Hindes wondered within himself if confession
would really do any good—whether
he would feel easier after it—and whether
he should please Heaven by the effort,
and gain some good from it for Wally?
It was against all his preconceived ideas
of comfort or right, and he shrunk from
the notion with aversion. What person,
not brought up to the practice from childhood,
does not? A priest will tell you
that therein lies the merit of the sacrifice,
but the sins that are usually confided to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
the keeping of the confessional are very
innocent ones. Few criminals take the
burden of their crimes there. They are
either too hardened, or too fearful. The
confessionals are, generally speaking, occupied
by women, who bring the same list
of follies, week after week, to be absolved
from. But that does not prove that there
are not plenty of heavier burdens lying
at the bottom of the lust of the eye and
the pride of life.</p>

<p>But Henry Hindes had had no experience
of the confessional, either as a
vanity or a relief. He knew what he had
heard concerning it, and he knew that, if
he entered it, it would be strictly incognito,
for he knew no Catholics, nor any priests.
One afternoon, when his sins were lying
on his mind, if possible, heavier than
usual, he saw the door of the little East-end
church standing invitingly open, and
walked in, and took a seat to rest himself.
The place was nearly empty. Two or
three women, clad in sober black, and a
sprinkling of half-grown children, were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
only occupants, and they were all engaged
in prayer. There was a sense of drowsiness
and a subtle smell of incense about
the little temple of God that was consonant
with the man’s perturbed feelings,
and seemed to pacify them. Besides, he
became interested in what was going on
around him, and it diverted his mind, for a
few brief moments, to watch it. Presently,
the heavy baize curtain, that screened one
of the confessionals, parted, and a woman
issued thence. She had evidently been
weeping, for she was wiping her eyes as
she came out, but her face was illumined
with joy. She entered the body of the
church and took a seat just in front of
Hindes. As she knelt down to return
thanks for her absolution, he ever heard
her murmur, ‘Oh! the comfort! the comfort!
Thank God for it!’ He watched
her earnestly after that, saw her take out
her rosary, and begin to tell her beads,
with her eyes raised and the same look of
happiness irradiating her features. He
found himself wondering what she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
had to confess, and if it was anything like—like—what
he might have to say. She
looked a good, kindly sort of woman, and
when, after a few minutes spent in prayer,
she rose and left the church, Henry Hindes
rose also and followed her into the open
street. She looked astonished when she
saw him hurrying after her—still more so
when he began to speak. She thought at
first she must have dropped something
in her seat, but her little hand-bag and
umbrella were safe. What could this
stranger want with her? Her surprise
was still greater when he opened his lips.</p>

<p>‘Forgive me for addressing you,’ he
commenced, ‘but do tell me, is confession
such a marvellous consolation to
you?’</p>

<p>The woman looked as if she thought he
wished to insult her.</p>

<p>‘Sir,’ she replied, ‘I saw you in church
just now. Surely you can answer that
question from your own experience?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot. I was in the church, it is
true, but I am not of your faith. But you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
looked so happy, so grateful, as you left the
confessional, that you almost made me wish
I were. Do tell me. Does confession
<i>really</i> relieve your mind? Does it make
your sins fall off you like an old garment?
My friends have told me so, but I cannot
believe it.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, sir, your friends were right, indeed.
It is the greatest comfort anyone
can have. Why, when the priest absolves
you, they are all gone. You not only
need not trouble yourself about them
again, but you are strictly forbidden to
do so. It would be doubting God’s goodness,
and the power He has imparted to
His priests. Oh, sir, do try it, only just
once,’ continued the woman, who saw in
Hindes a possible convert. ‘Just go to
dear Father Henniker on the right hand
side of the church, and he will explain it
all to you so much better than I can.’</p>

<p>‘But will this father, as you call him,
see my face?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no; he sits behind a grating and
you seem to be quite alone with God.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
You must put your mouth close to the
grating and whisper low, but he will hear
every word you say. And then the happiness
of absolution! You won’t know yourself
afterwards. I feel to-day as if I could
dance and sing.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, thank you, but I only
asked for curiosity. You are very good
to have told me so much. Good-afternoon!’</p>

<p>And, raising his hat to her, Hindes went
on his way. He had not meant to take
advantage of what he had heard, but
somehow, whenever he went out, his feet
seemed drawn to the same little church,
until it became quite a habit of his to go
and sit there and watch the penitents.
And one day, almost before he knew what
he was doing, he had lifted the baize curtain
of one of the confessionals and walked
inside.</p>

<p>Frederick Walcheren had passed through
his novitiate, and been ordained. The
die was cast. He was a priest. At first
his duties were much the same as they
had been during his stay in college, with
the exception of ministering at the Mass.
But, as he settled down into his new position,
they became more various. The
church to which he was attached was a
very small one, belonging to his own sect
of the Servite fathers. It had only two
priests attached to it, one of whom was
presently bound on a mission to the East.
When he left, Frederick Walcheren (or
Father Walcheren as we must henceforward
term him) was to take his place.
The novice entered on his new sphere
of action, dully, almost sullenly. He knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
he was unfit for the office he had undertaken,
and was mad with himself for not
having had more moral courage than to
accept it, and more moral fortitude to brave
the sneers, or the reproaches which would
have accompanied his relinquishment of
the sacred office he had once believed
himself able and willing to fill. As he
glanced round at his companions during
their hours of privacy, and read the indifference
on one face, the weariness on
another, the melancholy on a third, and
listened to the stilted speech they considered
it a sign of their calling to adopt,
he felt like the startled novice in Gustave
Dore’s famous picture, who has his eyes
opened all at once to the earthliness of
his surroundings—to the truth that, Church
or no Church, man’s nature is the same,
and God can subdue it just as well whilst
he remains in the world, perhaps better,
than when he has given up the outward
and visible sign of participation in it.</p>

<p>One of Frederick’s first duties, naturally,
lay amongst the poor of his parish, and, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
this department, he received a severe rebuke
before long, from his superior, Father
Henniker, for not adopting a more distinctly
clerical form of speech when speaking
with them of their various ailments
and troubles. In this dilemma, Frederick
had recourse to the counsel of his other
priestly companion, Father Grogan.</p>

<p>Dennis Grogan was an Irishman, a man
several years younger than Frederick Walcheren,
but who had entered the ministry
some time before. He was a genial, good-hearted
young fellow, though somewhat
unrefined, as Irish priests are apt to be, and
Walcheren felt less difficulty in talking to
him than to his superior.</p>

<p>‘Brother Grogan,’ he said one day when
they found themselves, for a few rare
minutes, alone and at liberty, ‘how did
you feel when you first became a priest?
Was it not all very strange to you?’</p>

<p>‘Strange!’ echoed Grogan, without raising
his eyes from his missal, ‘how could
that be, when my thoughts had been fixed
on nothing else for years beforehand?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>‘But it is so difficult all at once to shake
off the habits and customs of the world.
For instance, I have been used all my
life to plunge into a bath as soon as I
get out of bed, but Brother Henniker has
given me a long string of reasons, with
none of which I agree, why it is desirable
that I should relinquish the habit.’</p>

<p>‘If he thinks so, you are bound to obey
him! Why give another thought to such
a trifle?’</p>

<p>‘A trifle!’ cried Frederick, indignantly,
‘do you call cleanliness a trifle? Why,
it has been part of my religion! When
I lost my wife—when I had to give up
all that made life endurable to me, I said
there was only one thing that might not
go after it, and that was cold water! And
what harm can there be in it? I feel unfit
for anything if I am not clean.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps the undue longing you have
for this particular form of luxury is the
very reason you are now called upon to
give it up, brother,’ replied Grogan. ‘Remember!
there have been men so holy as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
to give up washing altogether, for the love
of God.’</p>

<p>‘Dirty beasts!’ cried Frederick, involuntarily,
and then recalled to the indiscretion
of which he had been guilty, by the horror
depicted in his companion’s eyes, he added,
‘But you don’t really suppose that we can
please the Almighty by not washing our
flesh, do you?’</p>

<p>‘I know that we cannot please Him,
unless we pay the strictest obedience to
the commands of our superiors. You have
not forgotten the vows you have taken so
lately already, surely, Brother Walcheren!’</p>

<p>‘Of course not, but I confess I was not
prepared to find they included the surveillance
of my toilet. However, it will be all
one a hundred year hence. When I lost
my wife, I lost everything!’</p>

<p>‘Brother,’ said Grogan, with his eyes
still fixed on his book, ‘would it not be
wiser to leave off alluding to the time when
you wallowed in earthly sin? It seems
to me that you think of it too much. You
have but one bride now, the holy Church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
and you owe all your thoughts and affections
and aspirations to her.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean that it is sin to think of,
or allude to, my dear lost angel?’ demanded
Frederick.</p>

<p>‘I think our superior would say that
it is your bounden duty to put all the
memories of the time when you lived with
sinful companions, in a sinful condition, on
one side.’</p>

<p>‘Sinful companions!’ exclaimed Frederick,
all the old man springing up in him
at once. ‘Do you mean to tell me you are
alluding to my late wife?’</p>

<p>‘I was certainly alluding to the time of
sin, which, by God’s grace, we trust you
have put away from you for ever.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Sinful!</i>’ repeated Frederick, with a
glowing face; ‘why, she was as fresh and
innocent as the dawn. She was worth all
the priests that were ever ordained put
together! Sinful! It is all very well for
you and me to talk about our sins, acted
and unacted, but never couple her memory
in my presence again with such a word,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
Brother Grogan, or I will not answer for
myself!’</p>

<p>And the newly-ordained priest rushed
from the apartment to subdue his unholy
temper in the privacy of his own dormitory.</p>

<p>The conversation was duly reported to
Father Henniker, who made a note of it,
with the intention of shipping Brother
Walcheren to some convenient station, a
good distance from London, as soon as
possible. He was a brand plucked from
the burning, but the brand was smoking
considerably still. The fire was not yet
quenched, and required a good deal more
cold water poured on it before it should
be. So he sent Frederick much oftener
amongst the poor. Here it was most
palpably borne in upon him that he had
mistaken his mission. He found no difficulty
in talking to his poorer brethren,
for he had a kind and generous heart, and
he felt deeply for their privations and
sufferings. But he found he was too apt
to talk with them over their troubles, and
advise them on the best way to get out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
them, instead of praying with them and
exhorting them to bless the Hand that
had afflicted them. He detected himself
more than once lamenting that he had no
private purse from which he could have
relieved their poverty, and telling them
not to rise when he entered the room, and
pay him so much well-meant attention
when they were not fit to leave their seats.
Once or twice he gave vent to an expression,
or a wish, that shocked himself—pulled
him up short, as it were, as he had
been used to pull up his horses, in the
olden days, upon their haunches, in order
to check their too animated career. But,
for a priest! Frederick’s constant inward
cry now was, ‘Why did I ever suppose I
was fit to become a priest?’</p>

<p>The face and form of his wife seemed to
haunt him as much as they did Henry
Hindes, and he could not bring himself to
confess, to his fellow-priests, how constantly
he thought and dreamed of her! He
knew he should do so—he had been reared
in the belief that, if he omitted one sin in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
confession, the whole was null and void,
and absolution a mockery. Yet, he could
not, and he would not, mention Jenny’s
name. He consoled himself with the idea
that it was not a sin; that she was an
angel in heaven, and he might dream of
her just as soon as of the Virgin Mary, or
any other saint. Still, the fact remained
that, where he had sworn to render implicit
obedience, he was thinking and acting
for himself, just as if he still inhabited
that world which he had voluntarily given
up.</p>

<p>This tale is not written with the view of
defending him. It only endeavours to
portray the workings of a mind that has
promised to give itself up into another
man’s keeping, and finds that it cannot do
so without resigning its liberty of conscience—its
rights as a man and a child of
God—all its strength, its decision and its
humanity.</p>

<p>Frederick Walcheren had not yet been
made a confessor. He was considered to
be too much of a novice—too young, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
perhaps, too handsome for so difficult an
office. And, in truth, he did not desire it.
He had received instruction in the duties
of the confessional, and they did not attract
him. He said openly that he feared he
should never gain the <i>sangfroid</i> necessary
for such a delicate duty. He had been a
man of the world, accustomed to restrain
his language and his allusions before
women, and the questions he was advised
to put to young girls, both of the educated
and uneducated classes, shocked him to the
last degree. He felt that he never could
ask them, never mind how long he might
be at the work—that he should feel himself
blushing all over, just as if he were in a
drawing-room instead of a confessional.
He confided these scruples to his director,
who begged him not to worry himself on
the subject—that it would all come natural
to him in time, and that, if his scruples did
not vanish with custom, there were plenty
of other fields open to him beside the confessional.</p>

<p>The little church which he belonged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
was called Saint Sebastian del Torriano.
Confessions were heard there on every day
of the week, if necessary, but the regular
time for them was on Saturdays, between
three and six in the afternoon, when Fathers
Henniker and Grogan were always ready
to receive their penitents, whilst Frederick
conducted Benediction. On one particular
Saturday, however, just as the clock was
on the stroke of three, Father Grogan
came hurriedly into the priests’ house, to
tell Frederick that Father Henniker had
been taken very ill with spasms of the
heart, and was totally unable to hear confessions.
<i>He</i> was therefore to occupy the
confessional instead of him, and they had
sent round to another church to ask the
services of a brother priest for Benediction,
which did not commence until four o’clock.
Frederick was rather taken aback by this
intelligence; however, there was nothing
to be done but to cast aside his book, don
his priestly vestment, and ensconce himself
in Father Henniker’s confessional.</p>

<p>There were only two confessionals in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
Saint Sebastian del Torriano, one on each
side of the chancel. They were divided
into two parts, the closed box where the
priest sat, and the open portion, which was
shaded by red baize curtains, where the
penitent knelt. Between these was a partition
formed of perforated zinc. This
rendered everything behind it dark to the
penitent. All he or she saw was the sheet
of zinc, through which their sins or troubles
had to be whispered in the confessor’s ear.
The priest, on the contrary, could see the
features and expressions of the penitents
plainly, on account of the light thrown behind
them by the opening of the curtains,
which were too narrow to draw quite close.
Few of the penitents knew this. It gave
them confidence to believe they were unseen
or recognised, and only the <i>habitués</i>
of the church cared to discover their identity.
Father Walcheren walked into the
confessional, feeling rather sheepish, and a
little shy. He soon found, however, that
the penitents left him but little to do.
They provided all the talk themselves, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
came laden with a string of small vices to
pour at his feet, with perfect confidence
of hearing the mechanical absolution pronounced
over them as soon as the list was
completed. They were, for the most part,
women, both young and old. Some were
in a tremendous hurry. He could watch
them from the body of the church fighting
their way into the confessional to get their
business over as quickly as possible, almost
pushing their neighbours aside in order to
reach him first. They were accustomed to
confess regularly every Saturday afternoon,
and did it as formally as they assumed
their walking things to go out. But they
were in a bit of a hurry. They were going
on to Mrs So-and-So’s afternoon tea, or a
flower <i>fête</i> at the Botanical, or, perhaps,
down to the Crystal Palace to see a dog
or cat show afterwards, and had promised
not to keep mamma waiting. Others,
again, were old women, who brought not
only their own sins, but those of all their
household, into the confessional with them—related
how bad their servants were, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
what difficulty they experienced in keeping
their husbands in the straight and narrow
path. This sort of penitent showed no
disposition whatever to hasten, was deaf,
indeed, to all the coughs that went on outside
to remind them that time was up, nor
took any notice of the faces that occasionally
peered round the curtain to see if the
confessor and confessed had both fallen
asleep, or died at their posts.</p>

<p>Frederick Walcheren felt sick and disgusted
with his fellow-creatures as he sat
in Father Henniker’s place and listened to
the mechanical details of their faults and
follies. Not one had approached him in a
sincere manner or an earnest voice. It had
all been rattle, rattle, prattle, prattle, get-it-over-as-quick-as-you-can
sort of work, without
any evidences of faith, or feeling, or
hearty repentance for the sins they had
committed. They had been told it was a
religious duty—they knew they couldn’t go
to Holy Communion the next morning unless
they had confessed—and had they
gone to bed that night without having done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
so, they would have felt quite uneasy, because
it had been their custom for years,
and not because they had any real penitence
in their hearts. Frederick Walcheren
was musing much after this fashion, and pronouncing
the absolution upon one after another,
wondering when the long string
would have come to an end, when the curtain
was raised again and a man stumbled
into the confessional. He did not ask a
blessing, but, as old Catholics seldom do,
knowing that as soon as they sink on their
knees it will be given them, Frederick pronounced
it in the usual form, and waited for
the confession to follow. To his intense
surprise, the first words the man said
were,—</p>

<p>‘I am not of your faith.’</p>

<p>His voice was so weak and husky that
Frederick Walcheren did not at first
recognise it.</p>

<p>‘Indeed!’ he answered, in a low whisper.
‘Then why are you here?’</p>

<p>‘Because I have a burden on my soul, an
intolerable burden, and I am told that, if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
confess it, it will leave me. Will you give
me absolution?’</p>

<p>Frederick now looked at the stranger
more particularly. He thought he had
heard his voice before, and, now he saw him
plainly, he recognised, to his intense astonishment,
Henry Hindes. Yes! decidedly
Henry Hindes—the man for whom he had
always had such an invincible dislike, without
knowing why—but so changed, in the
short space of a year, that he thought he
should never have known him again had he
not heard him speak. His first impulse was
to reveal his identity; the next moment he
remembered where he was, and for what purpose,
and shrunk further back on his seat, as
if it were possible that the penitent should
see him as plainly as he was seen. But, when
he addressed him again, he was careful to
disguise his own voice, and to speak as low
as possible.</p>

<p>‘I cannot say if I can give you absolution,’
he answered, ‘until I have heard your
confession. But God never refuses it to
the truly penitent.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>‘I <i>am</i> penitent, God knows!’ replied
Hindes. ‘My life is a misery to me on
account of my sin. I would wash it out
with my life’s blood if it were possible.’</p>

<p>‘I am listening to you,’ was all the answer
that the priest made.</p>

<p>‘Are you quite, <i>quite</i> sure that no one
will hear me?’ demanded the unhappy man.</p>

<p>‘No one but the God you have offended
and myself,’ said Frederick, in the same assumed
tone; ‘but place your mouth close to
the grating, and speak low.’</p>

<p>Hindes did as was required of him, and
began,—</p>

<p>‘I have committed a murder! Is there
any hope for me?’</p>

<p>‘A murder!’ exclaimed the priest, startled;
and then, remembering himself, he added,
‘there is hope for all!’</p>

<p>‘It was a girl,’ resumed Hindes, in a
shaking voice; ‘I had known her from her
childhood, and I had secretly loved her.
She taunted me whilst we were standing
near some cliffs, and in my rage I—God
forgive me!—I pushed her over them.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>Frederick Walcheren was nearly rushing
out of the confessional and seizing his
penitent by the throat; but he restrained
himself in time. But he could not speak
plainly. He sat in his box, paralysed with
horror and his desire for revenge. How
could he fail to guess what was coming!
The murderer of his Jenny knelt before
him. He knew it for a certainty, but he
forced himself to reply,—</p>

<p>‘Go on! Tell all!’</p>

<p>‘I loved her,’ wailed Henry Hindes; ‘I
would have given my life for hers at any
time, but she preferred another man, and
ran away and married him. I was commissioned
by her father to pursue them and
bring her back, if possible. I followed
her to Dover, and met her on the cliffs.
She was so lovely, so haughty in her pride
and love for that other man, that she
drove me mad. I reasoned with her. She
said she hated me—had always done so—should
do so to the end. It was her defiant
words that raised the devil in me.
I saw her standing perilously near the edge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
of the cliffs as she spoke to me, and put
out my hand to prevent an accident. I
grasped her by the wrist. She thought I
was going to lay violent hands on her,
and calling out, “Don’t touch me! Do
you want to murder me?” wrenched her
hand from mine. She put it into my head.
I swear before God I never thought of
it before. But, when she said those words,
the idea of preventing anybody ever having
her, since <i>I</i> could not, flashed into my
brain, and I pushed her—God forgive me!
I put out my hand and pushed her over
the cliff. That is the whole truth; but
I have been a miserable man ever since,
and Heaven has avenged itself upon me!
My only son has fallen down a flight of
stairs, and is likely to be a cripple for
life. Give me absolution! I am truly
penitent! Lift this awful burden off my
soul, and let me feel I am forgiven.’</p>

<p>The priest did not answer, but sat in
his box, with set teeth and clenched hands,
thinking, if he had his will, what he would
do to the wretch who had robbed him, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
so brutal a manner, of his beautiful young
wife.</p>

<p>‘Speak to me! I implore you,’ wailed
Henry Hindes. ‘I thought this confession
would ease my soul, but it feels no better.
I repeat I am truly penitent! Why cannot
I have absolution? Is it because I
am not of your faith? I will promise to
become a Catholic to-morrow if that
will bring me any peace. Speak! pray,
speak!’</p>

<p>At last Frederick Walcheren understood
that he must say something, or his conduct
would be open to misconstruction, but his
voice sounded like that of an old man;
no need to disguise it now.</p>

<p>‘Absolution,’ he replied, ‘is for the truly
penitent. There, you are right! But
the truly penitent make amends, for the
wrongs they have committed, to the world
as well as to God. A foul, uncalled-for
murder needs expiation according to the
law, as well as before heaven. The blood
of your victim cries to you from the
ground. I have no power to pronounce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
absolution over you until you have made
what reparation the law demands.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean that I must confess it
before men?’ asked Hindes, in a cold
sweat with terror.</p>

<p>‘Most certainly! You owe it to all of
whom you stole her life! You think only
of your own misery and fear! What of her
husband’s—her parents’—the society which
delighted in her youth, and beauty, and
innocence? Make your peace with them
first, and then ask forgiveness of God.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! I cannot, I cannot! I am a
married man myself. I have a wife and
children dependent on me! God cannot
wish me to own this deed—this accident—it
was more an accident than anything else.
I did not think what I was doing. My
rage—my desire of revenge overcame my
better feelings. Had I stopped to consider
for a moment, I should never have
done it. But there was no time. It
happened so suddenly, before I realised
what my hasty touch would do. Oh! father,
surely it will not be accounted against me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
as a murder. I was wrong to call it by such a
name. It was an accident! a pure accident!’</p>

<p>The priest’s voice came back like a
judgment.</p>

<p>‘I do not believe you, Henry Hindes.’</p>

<p>‘You know my name,’ cried the penitent,
starting. ‘Who are you?’</p>

<p>‘One whom you also know, or have
known, but that is irrelevant to the matter
in hand.’</p>

<p>‘You are mistaken! I know no priest,
nor have ever known one,’ replied Hindes,
trembling.</p>

<p>All his anxiety now was to get out of
the confessional before the priest, who
had evidently recognised his voice, should
also see his face. He little knew that
he had been gazing at it all the while,
noting its expression, and watching every
change that passed over it.</p>

<p>‘You are quite mistaken,’ he continued
hurriedly; ‘I am not the person you mentioned,
nor have I ever heard the name
before. I am a tradesman from the North
of England, and am only passing through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
town. I hoped to hear better news from
you, but it is of no consequence. I cannot
stay any longer. Good-afternoon!’</p>

<p>And then, his cunning coming to his aid,
he added,—</p>

<p>‘I have been only trying to see how far
I could go with you. A friend told me I
could get absolution for every sin in the
calendar, so I thought I would make up a
story about a murder. I suppose it was
very wrong of me, but we had a bet on the
subject, and I wanted to prove to him that
I was right. I trust you will forgive me.’</p>

<p>As he said the last words, he left the
confessional, and prepared to fly from the
church. But, as he did so, the door which
admitted the confessor to his portion of the
confessional also opened, and the face of
Frederick Walcheren looked forth from it.
Hindes turned involuntarily, and met his
gaze, and with a low cry turned round and
literally ran out of the sacred building.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>


<p>He had known so little of Frederick Walcheren
before Jenny’s death, and he had so
purposely avoided thrusting himself in his
way afterwards, that he had not had the
slightest intimation that he had entered the
Catholic Church as a priest. The discovery
was as great a shock to him as his
revelation had been to his auditor. How
he ever got back to Hampstead on that
eventful afternoon, he never knew. His
head and heart were in as rapid a whirl as
they had been when he committed the
murder; the murder which, he now made
sure, would, sooner or later, land him on the
gallows. There was but one chance for
him—the alleged secrecy of the confessional.
Could he trust to it? Would Frederick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
Walcheren’s vows prove adamant
against the awful news he had been called
upon to hear—the strong desire to avenge
his wife’s death which must be raging in
his breast at the present moment, unless,
on assuming his priestly robes, he had
parted with his manhood. Henry Hindes
pondered over this question, night and day,
for a wonder, morphia-free.</p>

<p>The shock of discovering <i>who</i> was his
confessor had acted on him as it might have
done on a drunkard. It had sobered him,
and, for a while, he conceived a horror of
the drug without which he had considered
it impossible he could live. Instinct came
to his assistance, and made him feel he must
keep his wits about him, in readiness for
what might happen. After all, no one had,
or could ever have, any proof against him.
And who would believe the word of a priest
from evidence taken in the confessional?
What witness was there to what he had
confessed? Besides, had he not cancelled
it all at the last, by saying it had been the
outcome of a bet between himself and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
friend, and why should he not stick to that
story?</p>

<p>Still, the knowledge that he had shared
his secret with any living being rankled in
his mind, and, after some days’ cogitation
with himself, he made up his mind to seek
out Walcheren and ascertain what he intended
to do in the matter. If his position
as confessor prohibited him from taking any
steps to disclose what had been confided
to him, things would remain as they were
before; if, on the contrary, he should betray
the least disposition to bring him to
justice, he would fly the country at once
and leave no trace behind him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he had left Frederick in a
state of mind hardly more enviable. He
was unable to quit the confessional directly
the murderer of his wife disappeared.
Several people were waiting to push their
way into his presence, directly he was at
liberty. So he was compelled to sit there,
whilst they poured their plaints into his
deaf ears, and he pronounced the absolution
over sins of which he had taken no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
heed. Who can blame him? He was a
priest, it is true, but he was a man still, a
lover, and a widower. Hindes’ hateful
confession had revived all the holiest, the
tenderest, the most passionately-mourned
portion of his existence. He was no longer
in the confessional. He was with his beloved
and murdered Jenny, in the Castle
Warden at Dover—in the ballrooms of
Hampstead—out on the breezy heath, or
in her pretty phaeton. She was with her
lover and her husband once more, not as
an angel from Heaven, or a pale corpse
lying in her cambric shroud, but as Jenny—his
laughing, saucy, living, lovely Jenny,
in whom he had taken such rapturous delight,
and of whom this man—this fiend—this
devil—had robbed him in the basest
and most cruel manner. He could think
of nothing else. His heart throbbed as
though he should suffocate. He longed
to rush out into the open air, but he was
condemned to keep his place until Benediction
was concluded and the confessions
were over. Then he went straight to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
sacristy and disrobed. He could not go
through the mockery of a prayer. Rage
was causing his whole frame to tremble.
Curses, not blessings, were on his lips.
He would not insult his Maker by addressing
Him whilst in so earthly a mood.
Father Grogan, who usually remained on
his knees for about an hour after service,
heaved a sigh as he saw the newly-ordained
priest tear out of the church as if he had
had more than enough of it, and put up an
extra petition, good soul, for his impatient
and undisciplined companion.</p>

<p>But Frederick Walcheren knew nothing
of it. He was hastening with all dispatch,
and in a state of the greatest excitement, to
seek an interview with his superior. But
Father Henniker was unable to see him.
The heart spasms, which he occasionally
suffered from, had been more violent than
usual, and the doctor had ordered him to
see no one that evening. So Father Walcheren
sent up an entreaty for leave of
absence on business of an important nature,
which was immediately granted him. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
was bursting with the intelligence which
had been communicated to him. He felt
that he must consult some friend as to the
action he should take concerning it. He
could not wait until the morning. It was
coming between him and all his duties.
Since he could not see Father Henniker,
he would ask for an interview with his old
friend, Father Tasker. So it was at his
residence that he presented himself, late in
the evening.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter, my dear brother?’
demanded Father Tasker. ‘You look
agitated.’</p>

<p>‘Agitated!’ echoed Frederick, ‘I am
bewildered—mad!’</p>

<p>‘Why, whatever can be the reason?
You alarm me by such violent expressions.’</p>

<p>‘Father Tasker, you have known my
story from the beginning—all my fears,
hopes, misery and despair. You know
how my beloved wife was snatched from
me; how I mourned her loss, and wondered
over the mystery of it.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes; but forgive me, my dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
friend, I hoped these sad thoughts had
all been swallowed up in the love of God
and the blessings of His holy Church.’</p>

<p>‘They will never be swallowed up by
anything so long as my life lasts,’ cried
Frederick, in his old impetuous way, ‘but
while I believed God had taken her from
me, I could be, in a measure, resigned to
His will. But to-day I have found out
that it was <i>not</i> by His will that we were
so cruelly separated. She was murdered!
Killed by a man! Pushed over those cruel
cliffs!—oh! my poor darling, why did I
let you leave my sight for one moment?
Why was I not there to protect you from
his villainy?—and dashed to pieces on the
beach beneath, out of a spirit of wicked
jealousy and revenge! And I have come
to ask you to tell me, as a man, <i>what shall
I do</i>? Think of the days when you were
free, when you, too, perhaps, loved and
lost, and advise me how to act, to bring
this murderer to justice?’</p>

<p>Father Tasker was visibly affected by
this recital. He had not yet forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
what it was to feel like a man, and the
distress of poor Frederick Walcheren
touched him to the quick.</p>

<p>‘My poor lad,’ he replied, forgetting for
the moment the sacred office which his
young friend had taken upon himself, ‘I
am deeply grieved to hear this story. I
had so hoped that your new and blessed
duties would completely drive all such
memories from your mind. To have them
renewed in this painful manner is most
distressing. But where did you hear this
intelligence, Frederick? Are you sure
that it is correct, or only a base rumour
set up to annoy you?’</p>

<p>‘I heard it in the confessional,’ replied
the young priest.</p>

<p>‘In the confessional?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; Father Henniker was taken suddenly
ill this afternoon, with one of his
heart attacks, and I was called upon to
take his place. After a while a man
entered, whom I recognised at the first
glance. It was—’</p>

<p>‘Hush! hush! stop my dear brother;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
what are you thinking of?’ exclaimed the
elder priest, warningly. ‘You must not
repeat any names. Remember, the confessional
is sacred.’</p>

<p>‘All right, father, I won’t; but it will
have to come out some day. Well, this
man entered, and after telling me he was
not a Catholic, said he had a great burden
on his mind and wished to try if confession
would ease it. He then went on to give
me the whole details of my darling’s
murder—how he had gone down to Dover
and met her on the cliffs, and she had
repulsed and taunted him—I can see her
doing it, my poor, brave girl!—and how
he had pushed her deliberately over the
rocks to the shingles below. He said he
had been miserable ever since, as well
he may have been, the brute! and had the
audacity to ask me for absolution for his
crime.’</p>

<p>‘Did you give it him?’</p>

<p>‘Not I! I felt much more like giving
him his quietus for evermore! I told him,
if he were penitent, to go and make his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
peace with the law first, and then ask for
the forgiveness of Heaven. It was all I
could do to speak to him with any degree
of decency.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think he did not recognise you,
brother?’</p>

<p>‘Not till the last, when I opened the
half door and looked at him. He knew
me then and ran away, horrified, no doubt,
at his own indiscretion. And now, father,
tell me what steps can I take? To whom
should I go? I feel as if I could not pass
through the Sunday services with this black
secret in my keeping. Tell me downright,
what shall I do?’</p>

<p>Father Tasker looked at him sadly.</p>

<p>‘You should know better than to ask
me. You can do nothing!’</p>

<p>‘<i>Nothing?</i> Are you laughing at my
agony?’</p>

<p>‘God forbid! I am grieving for this
fresh pain you are called upon to endure,
more than I can say. But I repeat, you
can do nothing. Have you forgotten the
solemn vows you have taken not to reveal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
anything you may hear in the confessional?
You would not have dreamt of coming to me
with a story you might have heard concerning
a stranger. Your hands are just as much
tied when the revelation affects yourself!’</p>

<p>‘You mean that I can do nothing to set
this matter right—that I am bound to let
the murderer of my wife go free?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, since he has confessed the
deed to you in your sacred office as confessor!
You are bound by your own oath
to maintain an utter silence on the subject.’</p>

<p>‘And he, this brute, is to walk about
the world, prosperous and esteemed—triumphing,
perhaps, in his secret crimes—whilst
my innocent darling lies unavenged
in her grave? Oh! it is too, <i>too</i>
cruel! I cannot believe it would be a
duty!’</p>

<p>‘It is a duty, a duty which you could
only overcome by breaking your most
solemn word, by violating your sanctity as
a priest, by disgracing your holy office and
bringing discredit on the sacrament of
confession. What are you thinking of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
Frederick? What would you have thought
in the olden days if <i>I</i>, for example, had
revealed to the world what you have told
me in the confessional?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that was different,’ exclaimed the
young priest passionately. ‘My confessions—most
people’s confessions—are of trivial,
everyday faults. But this—this heinous
murder, which cries aloud to God’s Throne
for vengeance—is not the same thing. If
murderers and such like criminals are to
believe that, by coming to us and depositing
their vile secrets in the confessional,
they may obtain relief and absolution, the
Church will be turned into a depository for
crime—a sink hole of wickedness without
any judgment to follow.’</p>

<p>‘Whatever you may think, Frederick,
the fact remains that, as a priest, you cannot
reveal this terrible secret, nor even breathe
a hint that you have heard it. With me
you are safe, but to no one else must you
mention the subject. Go home, my dear
brother, and pray to forget it, even to
forgive it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>‘<i>Never!</i>’ cried the young man, emphatically.
‘I should lie if I said I should ever
do either one or the other. Father Tasker,
I have had many doubts, as you know,
since entering the Church, whether I have
not made a grave mistake, but I have
none at the present moment. I see that I
have put myself in a wrong position. Had
I had the least idea of what I have heard
to-day—had I imagined, however vaguely,
that my precious wife had come unfairly
by the death which I always believed to
be due to an accident, nothing would have
induced me to bind myself by any vows
but those which should bring her murderer
to justice. And now that the bitter truth
has been accidentally revealed to me—that
I have met the villain face to face—you tell
me I must be silent, that I must brood
over my deep wrongs for a lifetime, praying
the while, perhaps, for the welfare of
the brute who goes scot-free. But I
cannot do it—I cannot! I wear the
vestments of a priest, but I am a man all
the same, a man who loves and has lost,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
who knows his enemy and thirsts for
revenge! And you bid me have patience
and keep silence. It is impossible! unnatural!
You lay a task on me that I am
unable to fulfil.’</p>

<p>‘You shock me,’ said the old priest.
‘You are indeed right, with such feelings,
to say you should never have accepted the
office you fill. What are you saying?
You cannot, and you will not, and it is
unnatural that you should. You forget
you are no longer a free agent, but must
do as the Church commands you—not as
you think, or feel.’</p>

<p>‘The Church may unfrock me, but she
cannot unmake me a man, with all a man’s
feelings and desires. My love I buried in
the grave with my darling, cheerfully, for
the Church’s sake. All my earthly amusements
and luxuries I have been willing to
give up in the same way. Life has nothing
much left in it for me now, and I am
desirous to dedicate the rest of it, if needful,
to the good of my brethren. But this
is something quite different. This is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
duty, in my own estimation—the blood of
my dearest possession crying out to me for
vengeance from the ground. I say, her
murderer shall not live to murder other
victims, perhaps in the same cold-blooded,
heartless manner! God’s justice and the
world’s laws demand it. It would be a
sacrilege to let him go free!’</p>

<p>‘And I repeat, Frederick, that if the
man had confessed to slaying the Christ
Himself, in the confessional, you could not,
as a priest, have betrayed him. If he
comes to you again, you can counsel him
to make the only reparation in his power,
by confessing his sin to the world, and
bearing the penalty, but you can go no
further.’</p>

<p>‘As if a mean-spirited cur like that, who
would stoop to wage war against a helpless
girl, would be brave enough to swing for
it!’ cried Frederick, contemptuously. ‘Not
he! When I told him I knew his name,
he tried to get out of what he had said, by
pretending he had confessed a made-up
story for a bet, but, when he saw my face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
his told a different tale. What man, born
of woman, could remain dumb under such
circumstances? It shames his manhood to
think of it. There is not a creature in this
vast city that, knowing what I know, would
not deliver the criminal up to justice.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps so. To conceal a crime under
ordinary circumstances is to be a partner
in its guilt. Had this wretched man told
you of his sin anywhere else than where
he did—had you been with him in the open
street, or in your private rooms, you would
be justified in refusing to keep his secret
for him, even though you are a priest. But
he came to you, believing that he was safe
in speaking openly to a confessor; therefore,
to betray his confidence would be to
perjure yourself, and without effecting your
object. You could not take the secrets of
the confessional into an open court of law
as witness of a man’s guilt. Who would
accept your testimony? How easy it
would be for the murderer to turn round,
as you say he attempted to do, and deny
that it was anything but a jest. Where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
would you be then? Disgraced, but unavenged.’</p>

<p>‘You are right, father,’ said Frederick,
with a deep sigh, as he rose to leave, ‘and
I have been an impetuous idiot. Thanks
for all your kindness and patience with me.
I fear I try it sorely at times. Good-night!’</p>

<p>He went back to his residence, but the
father’s last words rung in his ears meanwhile.
‘Had this man told you of his
guilt anywhere else.’ Would it be possible
to induce Hindes to repeat what he had
said in the confessional elsewhere? Would
he be too astute, too cunning, too incredulous
of the safety of such a thing, to repeat
his story? Or might he, if Frederick
could only conceal his hatred of him sufficiently
well, be cajoled into believing that
‘once a priest was always a priest,’ and
that the oath of silence was as obligatory
out of the confessional as in? The young
man shuddered as he thought of encountering
Hindes again, yet, for Jenny’s sake—Jenny,
who had said, poor child, almost
prophetically, how she hated and mistrusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
this man—he could manage, he thought,
to hide his aversion and loathing, if it
would serve the purpose of causing him to
betray himself, with confidence, under conditions
when he could take advantage of it
to deliver him over to justice.</p>

<p>‘Oh, what feelings are these?’ cried
Frederick, in his inmost soul. ‘Why did I
ever become a priest? I had much better
have enlisted in the army. I am not fitted
for my position. I told them all so, but
they would drive me into it. How can I
go on offering the Mass, and attending all
the services of the Church, with these burning
desires for revenge in my heart? In
another fashion I am as bad as this brute
Hindes. He goes about the world as a
whited sepulchre, and so do I. I wonder
if I shall ever have the courage to break
off my fetters. It would be one bold stroke
and I should be free again. People would
say, “How shocking. Fancy, he was a
Catholic priest!” and poor dear Father
Tasker and my cousin Philip would declare
I was lost for evermore; but would their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
saying so, or thinking so, make it a fact?
Which is better, that I should give up an
office for which I am not only unfit, but in
which I am a living lie, or go on with it,
dissatisfied with myself and all my surroundings?
After all, God, who knows my
thoughts and my intentions, is the only Person
Whose opinion I should fear, and I know
that He hates hypocrisy. One thing I am
sure of, that I cannot live a life of inactivity
whilst my angel’s death is unavenged, and
her murderer goes at large. The prayers
would blister my tongue. I am unfit for
any of my sacred duties whilst such thoughts
fill my mind. I wish—I wish, from my inmost
soul, that I was a better man, but I
am very earthly yet. Every thought
proves it. And yet, oh, my God! I shall
not serve Thee worse in the world than
here. Thou knowest, Who knowest all
things, that I shall not return to the
world I left. That has fled with all its
pleasures, but this life cramps me. I
am not myself. I have made a mistake.
Show me how to remedy it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>These were the thoughts that occupied
the mind of Frederick Walcheren, and he
was not a hypocrite in giving vent to
them. He had been a very wild and self-seeking
man before he knew Jenny Crampton,
thinking only of the gratification of his
senses, and caring nothing for the things
of the other world. But the Catholic
Church makes religion so much more
realistic than any other. She depicts the
saints and angels as being so much nearer
to us in an earthly sense—walking by our
sides as we journey through life, and taking
an interest in all our troubles and
pleasures (as, indeed, all the souls departed
do), that her votaries, especially
those who have been reared in her faith,
find it most difficult to shake off her influence,
or to forget her precepts. It is said
that a Protestant may be converted to
Catholicism, or Mahommedanism, or Spiritualism,
or any other ‘ism’; but a Catholic,
if he once rejects the faith of his fathers,
becomes nothing but a total disbeliever.
He either believes all or nothing. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
may or may not be true, but the exception
proves the rule. At all events, though his
wife’s death had not fitted Frederick Walcheren
to be a priest, it had made him think
very deeply, and the lessons he had learned
in his youth had returned with twofold
force upon his mind, and made him view
his past life in a light which would prevent
his ever returning to it. He viewed his
past career now as it really had been—the
outcome of his selfish desires—and he
mourned over its effects sincerely.</p>

<p>Amongst his other sins, the one he had
committed against Rhoda Berry haunted
him. The other women he had trifled
with had either been very well able to
take care of themselves, or they had been
more sinning than sinned against. Rhoda
Berry, of them all, had used only the
weapon of her own love against him, had
suffered the most in consequence, and had
complained the least. It was strange that
he—a priest—should find his thoughts
turning most to her—a simple, uneducated
girl—in this dilemma. But he saw plainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
that he must expect no help from his
fellow-clergy. They had relinquished the
world, with all things pertaining thereto,
and would only advise him to pray and be
patient, and regard his present state of
miserable uncertainty as a trial sent from
Heaven out of loving-kindness, and his
thirsting to avenge the cruel murder of
his wife as a sore temptation from the
Enemy of Mankind, which it was his
solemn duty to trample under foot. And
then this inability to disclose anything
heard under the seal of confession! If
that were true, Frederick felt he could
not lend himself to be the depositary of
state secrets, the keeping of which might
be, perhaps, a wrong to his sovereign, his
country and the people at large.</p>

<p>So he sat down and wrote a note to
Rhoda Berry, in which he called her his
dear friend, and said that, if she were likely
to be visiting London again, he would
much like to see her for a few minutes and
receive her in the common parlour of the
priests’ house, or call upon her at any place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
she might prefer. Rhoda showed this
letter to her mother, and her mother, as
usual, went to the cards for advice. The
oracle said, decidedly, ‘Yes.’ Rhoda was
to visit town for the express purpose of
seeing her late lover, and the journey
would be productive of good for both of
them.</p>

<p>‘I can’t say I see what luck can come
of it,’ said Rhoda. ‘If Fred were not yet
ordained, I might dissuade him from it,
but I said all I could last time we met, and
I might as well have talked to the table.
I can’t fancy him a priest, mother! It
seems too ridiculous. I often think what
baby will look like some day, when he is
grown up and bothers to know who his
father is, and I tell him a Catholic priest.
He’ll think I’m out of my mind.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t worry over that now, my girl,’
replied Mrs Berry, ‘there’s plenty of time
before you. Little Fred won’t trouble himself
about his father for many years to
come. And there’s no saying what may
happen before that comes to pass! I often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
fancy things will turn out different from
what you imagine. You’ll have a happy
life after all. I’m sure of that, whoever
you may pass it with.’</p>

<p>‘It’ll never be happy passed away from
Fred, mother. You may take your oath
of that,’ said Rhoda, shaking her head;
‘but I’ll go up and see him, poor fellow,
all the same. I never refused him anything
yet, worse luck! and I can’t begin now.’</p>

<p>Frederick Walcheren did not rest satisfied
with the ultimatum which Father
Tasker had passed on his conduct, with
regard to what he had learned in the confessional.
He had no hope of obtaining
a different opinion, but he considered it
right, before he acted on his own responsibility,
to leave no stone unturned to vindicate
his idea of what was just and right.
As soon as Father Henniker was sufficiently
recovered to be able to resume his
duties, he sought an audience with him,
and told him the whole story, carefully
withholding any details that might lead to
the identification of the parties concerned.</p>

<p>The older priest was very much shocked
by the recital. He felt for his young
brother keenly, so he said, but he had no
further consolation to give him. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
a terrible trial for him—sent by Almighty
God to test his faith and endurance of
suffering. It was a high honour conferred
on him by Heaven; he was called upon to
take up the cross in imitation of the Saviour
of Mankind, and to carry it, maybe, through
life. But there was no remedy except the
medicines which had been already prescribed
for him—Prayer and Patience, and
rejoicing in Suffering!</p>

<p>And he was a man with a burning,
aching heart, bowed down beneath a sense
of an irreparable loss, brought on him by
a fellow-man, and he writhed under these
recommendations to inactivity like a strong
man would writhe and chafe to rend apart
the cords that bound him, whilst what he
loved best was being cruelly tortured under
his very eyes.</p>

<p>He did not answer the father for a few
minutes, but sat with his head bowed down
and his eyes fixed upon the ground.</p>

<p>‘I fear you do not see this matter in
its proper light, brother,’ said Father
Henniker, after a long pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>‘If yours is the proper light, I cannot!’
replied Frederick.</p>

<p>‘It is not my light. It is the light of
the Church,’ said his companion.</p>

<p>‘But it has not shined on me,’ retorted
Frederick, quickly. ‘You make me feel I
am unfit for our holy office! I am a man
still, not a neutral creature, without feelings,
or passions, or warm, human blood
running through my veins. If I imagined
that ordination would cure me of all this,
I was mistaken! It has failed to do
so. On every side I receive the same
advice. Don’t feel—don’t think—don’t remember!
Be patient—be calm—be silent!
Act, live, do your duty as if such
things had never been, as if everything
were right within you, and God had not
taken the only thing which made your
life worth living from you at one cruel
blow!’</p>

<p>‘Hush! hush!’ interposed the priest.
‘When you compare the love you conceived
for a sinful woman, whose charms only
appealed to the lust of the eye, to the duty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
which you owe to the Almighty, you are
uttering blasphemy.’</p>

<p>‘A sinful woman!’ echoed Frederick.
‘Who presumes to call her so? You forget
she was my wife, father! No one shall
ever call her “sinful” in my hearing, were
it the Holy Father himself!’</p>

<p>‘I will not listen to such talk any longer,’
exclaimed Father Henniker, indignantly.
‘You are right when you say you have mistaken
your vocation, Brother Walcheren!
Leave my presence, and never enter it
again whilst such feelings obtain the mastery
over you!’</p>

<p>Frederick did as he was desired, biting
his lips with indignation at the rebuff, and,
retreating to his own room, did not speak
to his superior for some days to come.</p>

<p>It was while he was still warring with
the human passions which had been raised
in his breast, that he was informed one
evening that a gentleman desired to speak
with him, and on demanding his name,
received the card of Henry Hindes. A
close observer might have seen Father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
Walcheren’s hands clench as he read the
name on the card, but he told the man to
admit the visitor to his private sanctum,
in as calm a voice as he could muster.
Whilst Henry Hindes was being conducted
through the long stone passages, Frederick
tried to make up his mind how he should
address him, but his thoughts were all
chaos. He stood like a statue, with his
mind a blank, to receive—the murderer of
his wife.</p>

<p>Hindes entered, looking very cringing
and humiliated. He glanced round the
small, bare chamber on entering, to see if
there was any third person present to listen
to their conversation, but perceiving they
were alone, he plucked up courage to advance
a little nearer. He had made up
his mind to learn the worst, for he could
wrestle no longer with his agony of suspense.
As he advanced, Frederick Walcheren
retreated till the distance of the
room lay between them.</p>

<p>‘Not a step nearer, Mr Hindes,’ he
ejaculated; ‘give me some chance of remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
master of myself! Now, what
have you to say to me?’</p>

<p>‘Are you sure we are quite alone?’
inquired his visitor, glancing around him
fearfully; ‘that we shall not be overheard?’</p>

<p>‘No one will hear you,’ replied Frederick.</p>

<p>‘I know you—you recognised my voice
the other day,’ commenced Hindes, ‘and I
felt I must speak to you on the subject.
I have understood that every word uttered
in the confessional is sacred—that a priest
dare not reveal it, even if he would. Is
that true?’</p>

<p>‘It is true!’ replied the other.</p>

<p>‘And that a priest’s word would not be
taken, even if he did repeat what he heard
as a confessor—that he would be disgraced
and stripped of his cloth in consequence, so
that the secrets told in confession are as
inviolate as the grave!’</p>

<p>‘You have been informed aright. Were
it not so, the sacrament of confession would
be at a discount. Penitents would be afraid
to tell of their sins, the greatest of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
they confide to the ears of their confessor
without the slightest fear.’</p>

<p>‘I wanted to make sure I had been informed
aright,’ continued Hindes, with the
sweat of fear and agitation standing thick
upon his brow, ‘so I thought I would
come and ask you straight. You must be
aware that I did not know I was addressing
you last week, Mr Walcheren; in fact, I
had not heard that you had entered the
Church. Naturally, you would have been
the last person I should have chosen for
such a confidence.’</p>

<p>‘Naturally!’ repeated Frederick.</p>

<p>‘It was an awful thing to have to say,’
said Hindes, trembling; ‘but you assure
me it will go no further. I will do anything
to ensure this. Become a Catholic
to-morrow, or leave the country and promise
not to return to it. I am truly penitent,
Mr Walcheren, indeed I am, and ready to
prove my sincerity in any way you may
choose to point out to me!’</p>

<p>‘I have already told you, sir, that the
secrets of the confessional are inviolate, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
the Church demands no penance except
such as shall be pleasing to Almighty
God! Since you say you are penitent,
you have, doubtless, said the same to
Him.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, indeed! I have tried to pray, but
heaven seems so far off for such as I.
But it was hardly a crime. It was more
an accident than anything else. If I could
only make you believe this.’</p>

<p>‘I always did believe it, until your own
lips told me otherwise.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes! but in confession I wished
to make the worst of my error, in order to
see if I should have absolution for the
worst. But it really <i>was</i> an accident! I
assure you, on my honour.’</p>

<p>‘Mr Hindes,’ said Father Walcheren,
sternly, ‘let us have no fooling, if you
please! I cannot listen to two stories.
Last week you said, distinctly, that you did
it by design. Now you want to make out
it was an accident. But I shall choose to
believe that what you said in the confessional,
when you thought you were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
speaking to a stranger, was the true
version of the story.’</p>

<p>‘It was, it was; but it is safe with you!’
cried Hindes, as though he felt himself
beaten, and declined to fight any longer.
‘I will tell you the whole truth, indeed I
will! It will be a comfort to get it clean
off my soul.’</p>

<p>At this critical moment it flashed
through Father Walcheren’s mind that he
should warn his penitent that he was not
in the confessional, but he could not.
Jenny—his murdered Jenny, seemed to
flit before him, with her beautiful features
all soiled with the damps of death and
almost indistinguishable through corruption,
crying aloud for justice on her
assassin, and, right or wrong, he could
not, and he did not, speak.</p>

<p>‘It happened just as I told you the
other day,’ continued Henry Hindes. ‘I
loved her—don’t be angry with me, it is all
over now, you know—and I would not have
harmed her for the world, but I loved her
long before she ever knew you, and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
marriage made me jealous as well as angry.
Mr Crampton deputed me to follow her
down to Dover and make her an offer to
return home, on the condition that she gave
you up and allowed her father to annul the
marriage, on a plea that you took a false
oath concerning her age. When I arrived
at the hotel she had gone out, and I
wandered on the cliffs to beguile the time,
and there I met her.’</p>

<p>‘Go on!’ said Frederick, curtly.</p>

<p>‘I told you the rest,’ replied Hindes,
beginning to feel uneasy at the other’s
manner.</p>

<p>‘I wish to hear it again. Whilst you
are about it, you had better tell all.’</p>

<p>‘I had no intention of injuring her, Mr
Walcheren; indeed, you must believe that!
I told her all her father had commissioned
me to say, and she laughed in my face at
the idea. She wanted to know what business
it was of mine to interfere in her affairs,
and why her father had not gone down himself
to make his proposals in person. And
then, I was mad enough to tell her the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
reason that I took such an interest in all
that concerned her. I told her how long
I had loved her.’</p>

<p>‘You insulted her, in fact,’ exclaimed
Frederick, making a step forward.</p>

<p>‘No, Mr Walcheren, no,’ cried the
coward, cringing before him; ‘I did not,
upon my honour.’</p>

<p>‘Your honour,’ sneered the other.</p>

<p>‘I did not insult her; indeed I thought
too highly of her for that. But she goaded
me on to saying what I did. And then
she turned round on me with such bitter
scorn that she drove me beside myself.
She almost spurned me from her in her
mocking pride, and I saw she was perilously
near the edge of the cliff. I stretched
out my hand and laid it on her arm to save
her from falling backward. But she
wrenched her wrist from my grasp, crying
out, “You brute! You want to push
me over the cliffs now, I suppose.” Upon
my soul, Mr Walcheren, I had never dreamt
of such an awful thing before. But, as she
said the words, I suppose the devil entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
into me,—something did, at any rate—and
I thought, “And if I do, no one will have
you evermore. If <i>I</i> can never hope to
call you mine, I can prevent Walcheren
doing so.” I was mad—I must have been
mad—for I had loved her so dearly, ever
since she was a little child, and yet, at that
moment, I seemed to have but one wish—to
see her out of the reach of everybody,
even myself—to know she would be unable
ever again to taunt me, or despise me, or
laugh over my infatuation. So, without
thinking of the consequences, I gave her a
push backwards instead of a pull forwards,
and you know the rest. She fell—and I
have never known a happy hour since. I
don’t think I shall ever have a happy hour
again.’</p>

<p>‘Not if I can help it!’ replied Frederick,
with emphasis.</p>

<p>Hindes started, and changed colour.</p>

<p>‘But you cannot betray me. My revelation
is sacred. You said yourself that
the secrets of the confessional are inviolate.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>‘I know I did. But <i>this</i> is not a confessional,
Mr Hindes.’</p>

<p>The wretched man glared round him
like a rat who has been trapped.</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to say that you are not
bound to keep secrets told <i>out</i> of the
church?’</p>

<p>‘A priest is bound to maintain utter
silence on all matters revealed under the
seal of confession, whether in the church
or out of it, but you and I are in the
position of two private individuals. You
came to call on me like any other person;
therefore, it lies in my discretionary power
to keep what you have told me this evening
to myself, or not.’</p>

<p>‘My God!’ cried Hindes, ‘I am lost!’</p>

<p>Then the nerve which he had ruined by
the use of morphia entirely forsook him,
and he fell on his knees and crawled to the
feet of the man he had so sorely wronged,
like an abject animal.</p>

<p>‘Mercy! mercy!’ he groaned, ‘don’t
visit my crime upon my head, for the sake
of my poor wife and children. I loved her.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>‘Silence, sir!’ thundered Frederick,
‘remember you are speaking of <i>my wife</i>!
Mercy!’ he continued, after a pause, ‘what
mercy did you have on me, when you cut
my dream of love so cruelly short, and in
so devilish a manner? What mercy had
you on her, my sweet, innocent, loving
Jenny, when your accursed hand hurled
her over those awful rocks? My love!
my darling!’ he continued, pacing the
floor of his room in his agitation, ‘why
was I not by your side at that fatal
moment, that I might have made this
fiend pay the penalty of his crime by
sharing your fate? My wife—my wife—and
he asks me to show mercy upon him!’</p>

<p>‘Mr Walcheren! I will do anything—anything—if
you will only keep my secret
now. It can do you no good to publish
it, nor <i>her</i> either. Let me go free and
I will pay any penalty you like. I am a
rich man. If your Church demands it, I
will pay half my fortune into her coffers,
or, if you wish it, I will sign a paper,
promising to leave England at once—to-morrow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
if you insist upon it—and never
show my face in the country again; I will
perform any penance you may put upon
me, only don’t make the matter public
property after this length of time.’</p>

<p>He had forgotten, in his cowardly fear,
that Walcheren had no witness against
him, that his crime had been committed
in secret, and that an English jury had
acquitted him, and all men, from blame.
His conscience had turned him into such
a sorry poltroon that his memory had
departed with his manliness. He grovelled
before his opponent on the ground—he
even attempted to kiss his feet, but
Frederick Walcheren spurned him from
him with his boot.</p>

<p>‘Don’t touch me, you brute!’ he exclaimed,
using involuntarily the very words
poor Jenny had blurted forth in her indignation,
‘your very lips are contamination!
Once for all, I will <i>not</i> spare you. If you
escape to the uttermost ends of the earth,
I will pursue you there! You shall walk
no longer among your fellow-men like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
whited sepulchre. If I unfrock myself
in order to obtain it, I will have my
revenge!’</p>

<p>‘I have tried to make amends,’ groaned
Henry Hindes, who was still upon his
knees. ‘I have not used the money Mr
Crampton left to my son. It is all there;
I intend to endow a church or an hospital
with it. But it was <i>hers</i>. It more justly
belongs to you; you shall have it, every
farthing, with double interest, if you will
only consider your intention again and
contemplate how little good you will do
yourself and others by carrying it out.’</p>

<p>‘You would bribe me with money, you
miserable cur!’ replied Frederick, witheringly—‘pay
me for my wife’s murder—satisfy
my craving for revenge by so many
pounds, shillings and pence! But you
will find I am not such an usurer as you
imagine. I have not been brought up to
trade, and if I had, I should not trade in
my heart’s affections. Be silent! I will
listen to no more from your accursed lips.
You have said enough! Leave my presence;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
but don’t think to hide yourself from
me. I will leave the priesthood to-morrow—I
will leave the Church itself—I will
resign my hopes of salvation, if need be,
but you shall not go unpunished for this
hideous crime!’</p>

<p>So speaking, Frederick Walcheren left
the room suddenly, slamming the door after
him, whilst Henry Hindes remained on
the floor, with the tears running down his
cheeks. When he found himself alone,
he rose from his knees and slowly quitted
the apartment, not knowing what to do or
where to go, or whom to consult, on the unhappy
position in which he found himself.</p>

<p>The young priest was still pacing the
floor of his dormitory, in the greatest disquietude,
when a lay brother appeared, to
tell him that a lady wished to speak to him
in the common parlour, where the clergy
usually receive their female visitors. Frederick
tried to calm himself as he went down
to meet her, but he felt very unequal to
administering comfort, or giving advice to
anyone. But what was his relief, on entering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
the parlour, to find that his visitor was
Rhoda Berry. She was robed all in black,
and looked so quiet and graceful that he
was not surprised that the brother had
called her a lady. Half his care seemed to
fall off his shoulders as he recognised her.</p>

<p>‘Oh! Rhoda,’ he exclaimed, coming forward
eagerly to greet her, ‘how good it is of
you to answer my appeal so soon. Were
you surprised that I should wish to see you
again? I am in great trouble, and I long for
your advice and counsel. You were always
giving me good advice in the old days,
Rhoda, so you must do the same now.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, if I can,’ replied the girl, in an
astonished tone; ‘but what advice of mine
can benefit you, now that you are a priest,
so high above me and so far, far away?’</p>

<p>‘Do you think I must necessarily be so
high above you, Rhoda, just because I have
been ordained,’ said Frederick, sadly. ‘I,
on the contrary, have but lately found out
that I am lower than I even believed myself
to be; full of the old worldliness, the
old envy, malice and all uncharitableness.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>‘I don’t believe it,’ replied Rhoda, stoutly,
‘you were never anything like that, Fred—I
beg your pardon, I meant Mr Walcheren—’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense! call me Fred, Rhoda.
What else should I be to you than that?’</p>

<p>‘But <i>now</i>—’ said Rhoda, dubiously, ‘it
sounds so disrespectful.’</p>

<p>‘Does it? Never mind. It eases my
heart to hear it. I feel very much alone
sometimes, Rhoda, and as if I had isolated
myself from all who loved me.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose you do, but perhaps the feeling
will wear off with time. But I do not
like to hear you accuse yourself of faults of
which you were never guilty. I am sure
you were never either envious or malicious.
You were always the most kind-hearted and
generous of men, at least to me. So I am
sure you cannot have become uncharitable
now.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps I have had more cause lately
to bring my bad qualities into play. I have
had a great shock, the last week, Rhoda! I
have discovered that my dear wife did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
meet her death by an accident, but was
foully murdered.’</p>

<p>The girl sprung from her seat with a
genuine exclamation of horror.</p>

<p>The dead woman had been more than
her rival. She had actually ousted her from
her lover’s affections, and she had had many
bitter and envious thoughts about them
both. But, when she heard that she had
been murdered, all her resentment vanished
in a flood of pity so vast, that she felt, at
that moment, as if she would have laid down
her own life to bring her back again. And
how she pitied <i>him</i> too—her poor lover,
whose infidelity to herself had met with so
terrible an ending.</p>

<p>‘Oh! my poor, poor boy!’ she cried, forgetful
of his priesthood and everything,
except that once he had been her own;
‘how sorry I am for you. How did you
hear it? Who did the awful deed? What
reason could anyone have had to injure you
so fearfully?’</p>

<p>And then the tender-hearted girl sat
down in her chair again and burst into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
tears—partly for poor dead Jenny, and
partly for herself.</p>

<p>‘I knew you would feel for me,’ replied
Frederick. ‘You have been a good friend
to me all along. I cannot answer all
your questions. If I could, I should not
have need of your advice. But listen to
me, and I will tell you the whole story.’</p>

<p>He drew a chair opposite to her on the
other side of the table, and leaned his arms
across it.</p>

<p>‘You have heard of the confessional,
Rhoda, where Catholics tell their sins to
a priest, and, when truly penitent, receive
absolution. Last Saturday week, Father
Henniker, one of our priests, was ill, and I
was ordered to take his place in the confessional,
and as the people who confess
cannot see the face of the confessor, no
one knew but that Father Henniker was
in his usual place. Do you understand?’</p>

<p>‘Perfectly!’</p>

<p>‘Whilst I was engaged thus, a man
entered the confessional, and, to my horror
and amazement, told me the whole history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
of my darling wife’s—You don’t mind my
calling her that before you, do you, Rhoda?’</p>

<p>‘No, no; call her just what you like. I
should not love you—I mean, I should
not <i>have</i> loved you—Fred, if you had
married her without caring for her.’</p>

<p>‘I did you an injustice by the question.
You are too true-hearted a woman to mind
it. Well, this man related the whole
dreadful story to me, and told me that he
had killed her himself—that she had not
fallen over the cliffs by mistake, but that he
had pushed her over—the villain!—on purpose,
and with the design of killing her!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Fred, what did you do?’ exclaimed
Rhoda, with her blue eyes opened to their
widest extent.</p>

<p>‘My dear, I could do nothing. That
was the terrible part of it. I had to sit
there and listen to the account of his
villainy and make no sign. But, as he left
the confessional, I opened the half door on
my side and showed my face, and he
looked as though the heavens had opened
to rain down judgment on him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>‘You knew the man, then, and he knew
you,’ said Rhoda.</p>

<p>‘Yes! but I am bound by the most
solemn oaths not to tell the name nor
communications of any penitent who confesses
to me. Oh! Rhoda, pity me!
You can fancy what I felt, cooped up
there, and compelled to listen to perhaps
a dozen more confessions, without the
slightest idea of what they were all
saying. I think some of them must have
been rather astonished to have been let
off so easily, for I absolved the whole lot
without a murmur. All I could think of
was how I could escape and take counsel
of someone. My head and my heart were
on fire! Had I followed my natural
inclination, I should have rushed down
the aisle after the brute and seized him
by the throat, and squeezed his life out of
him then and there. But I had to wait
till I was set at liberty, and then I rushed
to Father Tasker, an old friend of mine,
and asked him what I ought to do about
it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>‘And he told you—?’</p>

<p>‘That I could do nothing, that, by reason
of my office, I must sit down like a dummy,
and let this murderer walk about the world
scot-free. That I must pray and hope, and
trust that someone else might bring him to
justice, or try and persuade him to confess
his crime to the law, but failing this, I
could do nothing but be patient under my
heinous wrongs. <i>Patient!</i> when my beautiful
girl lies in her grave, murdered, in the
spring-time of her youth, by a jealous brute
who could not bear to see our happiness;
when my married bliss has been cut short,
and all my earthly hopes shattered for ever;
when I have pledged myself, in my despair,
to be quiescent and forego my revenge.
Rhoda! it has nearly driven me mad! I feel
like that poor husband, of whom we read
during the Indian mutinies, who was bound
with cords whilst his lovely young wife was
outraged and murdered before his eyes, the
while the foam and blood dropped from his
mouth in his rage and agony. Here am I,
chained—bound—helpless, and all through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
my own folly. I cannot bear it! I cannot—I
cannot!’</p>

<p>‘Hush! hush, dear Fred, someone will
hear you!’ exclaimed the girl, cautiously,
as she rose and listened at the door. ‘I believe
there is somebody in the passage now.
Cannot I see you somewhere else, in order
to talk over this unhappy business? May
you not leave this place?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly! I am free to go and come as
I choose. Where are you staying in town?’</p>

<p>‘At my old address. The landlady knows
me, and is very kind. I do not intend to
remain over to-morrow, unless you want
me. You see, I have to leave the—the—little
one with mother, and he is getting
rather troublesome now.’</p>

<p>‘Is he quite well?’ inquired Frederick,
wistfully.</p>

<p>‘Yes; but can you come and see me to-night?’</p>

<p>‘I can, and I will, at seven o’clock. Till
then, good-bye.’</p>

<p>And he let her cautiously out of the front
door.</p>

<p>The young priest was punctual to his appointment,
and found Rhoda ready to receive
him. She was alone, and in the room
where they had so often met before, yet she
displayed no self-consciousness of the fact. It
was evident that she had accepted the position,
in which they now stood to one another,
as final. Frederick Walcheren a priest was
as dead to her as if he lay in his grave.
She saw in him only a friend, whom she had
once dearly loved and trusted in, to be
advised, comforted and maybe led aright.
Had she been a Catholic, this state of mind
would not have been extraordinary on her
part, since, for a Catholic to think of a priest
otherwise than a priest, would be sacrilege.
But Rhoda was a Protestant, who had been
brought up to detest Popery, and everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
connected with it, so that the reverential
attitude she now assumed towards her former
lover was due, not to his Church, but himself.
She cared nothing, individually, for his office,
but she still cared too much for him to
tempt him to say a word, or do an act, which
should become a reproach to him. She rose
as he entered, but did not even hold out her
hand in greeting. All the courtesy she extended,
was to ask him if he would like a
cup of tea after his walk.</p>

<p>‘Thanks, Rhoda,’ he replied; ‘I think it
would be very refreshing, for I have just
come off a long round of visits. The women
of the poorer classes I can see at any time,
but it is only in the evenings that I can catch
the men.’</p>

<p>‘But there is not nearly so much trouble
to induce the men to go to church in your
religion as there is in ours, or so I have
heard,’ said the girl, as she busied herself
with the kettle and the teapot.</p>

<p>‘No, I suppose not, because they are
reared from infancy to believe that it is a
mortal sin not to attend Mass once on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
Sunday. And a mortal sin, unconfessed,
means, with us, eternal damnation. But
what is the use, Rhoda, of a duty performed
under such a dread? If it is only done from
fear of hell, it may as well not be done at all.’</p>

<p>‘We have not met to-night to discuss
religion,’ said Rhoda, as she placed his cup
of tea before him, ‘and you would never
convert me if we had. You may remember
that was one of the matters we used to
argue about in the past, and finally agreed
that each of us was to have our own way.
But I quite agree with you, that a duty performed
from the fear of man’s opinion, or of
future punishment, is just worth nothing in
the eyes of God. There is only one person
we have to please, or to account for our
actions to, and that is Himself.’</p>

<p>‘You used not to think so much of God
when I first knew you, Rhoda,’ said
Frederick, ‘or, at all events, I do not remember
ever hearing you speak of Him.’</p>

<p>The tears filled Rhoda’s eyes.</p>

<p>‘No, perhaps not. But things that have
happened since then may have drawn my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
thoughts more that way. You must feel
yourself, Fred, that when one knows
trouble and loss, one naturally goes to
Heaven for comfort. It has been the
same with you. That is why people say
that it is sent to turn us to God.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, for such as I, perhaps, Rhoda, who
was so selfishly absorbed in my own joy
as to forget the unhappiness I caused to
others—I seemed to have no resource but
to devote the rest of my life to Heaven.
But you are young, and your loss has not
been like mine! I have had to give up a
wife who was far too good for me, whilst
you lost only a most worthless friend, unworthy
of the name, who did his best to
ensure your destruction with his own.’</p>

<p>‘Let us talk of what we were doing this
afternoon,’ responded the girl, quietly. ‘I
have thought of nothing else since we
parted. It is so dreadful, so very, very
sad; so terrible for you to hear so suddenly,
and when you had no idea of such a thing.
You told me that you had applied for
counsel to your fellow-priests, and all they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
could advise you was to have patience.
Patience for <i>what</i>, Frederick?’</p>

<p>‘For nothing, Rhoda. Patience to see
the murderer of my poor wife walking
about the world as usual, beloved by his
family, respected by his friends, and honoured
by his fellow-men. That is all. I
may live for the next fifty years—so may
he—eating my heart out to know my great
wrong goes unavenged, and pacifying myself
with prayer the while—prayer that my
enemy may find grace hereafter, I suppose,
as well as here.’</p>

<p>‘Fred,’ said Rhoda, leaning her elbows
on the table opposite to him, and looking
him steadily in the face, ‘if you had your
whole will in this matter, what would
you do?’</p>

<p>‘Hang the brute fifty times, and gloat
over his agony all the while.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, you wouldn’t,’ she replied,
shaking her head.</p>

<p>‘I would, Rhoda, I would. What!
spare him who had no mercy on my lost
darling? You do not know me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>‘I think I do, better than you know yourself.
You feel like that now, certainly, but
when it came to actually <i>doing</i> it, you
would draw back and say, “This is not
my work. Leave him to God.”’</p>

<p>‘And let my darling lie in her bloody
grave unavenged? Never!’</p>

<p>‘Is she not avenged? You have described
to me what an abject, trembling,
miserable object her murderer is! Do you
suppose he has not suffered such tortures
of remorse as would make the gallows a
welcome relief to him? There is no hell,
Frederick, like that which we carry within
ourselves—the worm that dieth not.
Leave this wretched man to his own
remorse! That will prove a greater hell
to him than the hangman’s rope, and be a
jewel in your heavenly crown.’</p>

<p>‘But <i>why</i> should I do this, Rhoda? I
can understand the priests telling me I
must forego my revenge because I must
not violate the secrets of the confessional,
yet, even they said that, if the confession
were made to me in private, as it was this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
afternoon, it would be legitimate for me to
bring the criminal to justice. But you say
just the opposite. Why?’</p>

<p>‘Because I am not speaking according
to any formula, Frederick, of what the
Church will, or will not, permit you to do.
I am talking to you as a friend who thinks
only of your individual good, and nothing
of what people or Churches will say. I am
thinking only of how God will view the
matter, and what He might say when you
had brought this murderer to earthly justice.
“Well! and now that you are satisfied with
regard to him who robbed you, how about
yourself? Have <i>you</i> never robbed your
neighbour? Have <i>you</i> murdered no good
thing which he prized?—never taken from
him anything which you can never give
back again? Is there no murder but that
of the mortal life?” Oh! Fred, I do not
mean or wish to reproach you, but I want
you to consider your own past life—your
life and mine—and see if we are not liable
to make amends in the sight of God as
well as our fellow-creatures—even this poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
murderer, on whom you thirst to take your
revenge.’</p>

<p>The young man had hidden his face in
his hands as she spoke to him, and, for a
few moments, was too absorbed in thought
to answer her. Here was what the world
would have called his victim—the girl he
had betrayed under a promise of eternal
fidelity—who had trusted in him and been
deceived—who had never blamed nor reproached
him, but accepted her sad fate in
all humility, teaching him true Christianity
as no one had ever taught him before.</p>

<p>He had robbed her of her good name
and her virtue. He had murdered her
belief and faith in him. He had taken
from her that which he could never restore—her
spotless reputation, and her pride in
herself. He had left her to support her
shame and sorrow alone—the reproaches of
her family, the scorn of her companions—whilst
he had been revelling in Jenny’s
beauty and Jenny’s love, and mourning
over her death and his own exceeding
loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>Yet, Rhoda had forgiven him in the
divinest manner. She had felt with him
in his sorrow, but never asked him to share
hers. She had listened, with all sympathy
to his tale of misery, but never once
alluded to her own. She had been a true
friend to him in all things, and, if his life
could do her any good, he owed it to her;
and then, with a deep groan, he came back
to himself and remembered that he was
dead to the world; he could benefit no
one in it any more; he had made himself
a cipher, a machine, an automaton, to be
moved only by the will of others, and
never to think or act for himself. The
groan alarmed Rhoda. She feared she
had said too much.</p>

<p>‘Forgive me,’ she said softly, ‘if I was
over bold. I forgot, for the moment, what
a gulf there is between us, and fancied
I was scolding you as of yore. You will
not think too much of what I said. It is
only a girl’s opinion, after all, and you
should know so much better than I.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, <i>should</i>,’ echoed Frederick Walcheren,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
moodily; ‘but the question is if I
do! Don’t blame yourself, Rhoda. You
have put things in a new light before me,
and I thank you for it. I will go home
and think over the matter again. After
all, you are right! What real good would
this man’s swinging do me? It cannot
restore my murdered wife nor my own
peace of mind. I should be none the
better for it.’</p>

<p>‘I am sure you would not, and especially
if you had been the means of bringing
him to justice. It would only add another
link to your chain of sorrow. Besides,
Fred, it would cast, as it were, a blot on
your ministry. I feel shy of touching on
such a delicate subject, but you will stand
even this, I know, coming from me. The
first fault, my dear, was your own. Had
you not married that young lady without
the consent of her parents, she would never
have been placed in so dangerous a
position. This man would not have
followed her, and she would have had no
chance of enraging him. There have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
faults on all sides. How can you tell, if
you had been placed under the same circumstances
as this wretched murderer,
whether you might not stand at this
moment in the same position? You
know I am not attempting to defend him.
His crime excites the greatest abhorrence
in my eyes, especially as it has so cruelly
hurt you. But I cannot help feeling the
same about all murderers—that, but for
God’s grace, we might have encountered
the same lot. How many hasty blows are
given, how many more intended—any one
of which might, if dealt a few inches
nearer or farther, cause death instead of
mere pain. You say this man told you
that his life had been a curse to him
ever since—that he was in despair. Is
that not sufficient punishment for his
sin? What can be more terrible than
a life of remorse? The gallows would
be preferable a thousand times over.
Don’t try to hurry him out of the
world before he has repented and tried
to make such amends as may be in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
power. Perhaps God may send the
thought to him. Perhaps your leniency
may have the same effect! At any rate,
Fred, whatever may be his ultimate fate,
don’t <i>you</i> have a hand in it! <i>Don’t</i>, for
the sake of the old days!’</p>

<p>The tears were standing in her bright
eyes as she leaned across the table and
put her hand upon his arm. He placed
his own hand over it.</p>

<p>‘Were the old days very dear to you,
Rhoda?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘You know they were, but it is of no
use talking of it. Since your lot in life is
fixed, it would be foolish to revert to the
time when you thought otherwise from
now. I hear your voice, and fancy I have
got my old friend again, but, when I look
at you, dressed in that strange manner,
and with your beautiful brown hair cropped
off, I can hardly believe you are the same
Fred I knew. And it is best so, is it
not?’</p>

<p>‘But what I am afraid of, Rhoda, is that
my face and clothes are the only things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
that are changed about me. That is one
thing I wanted to talk to you about. I
fear I have made a terrible mistake in becoming
a priest. You see, this time last
year, I was so mad with grief, the shock I
experienced had so shattered my nerves,
that I was not myself. All I wanted was
to find forgetfulness, even at the sacrifice
of worldly good. My friends and relations
worked largely on my frame of mind, by
assuring me the peace I longed for was to
be found only in the Church. My mother
and godfather had intended me for that
profession, and I was in too despondent a
state of mind to care what they did with
me, or made of me. So I drifted into ordination,
not from a love of God, but of
despairing grief for my great loss. And
now, I am sure, I am unfitted for it. I am
not nearly good enough. My thoughts
and desires are all with the world I have
left. I have no vocation for the ministry.
What am I to do? Tell me, Rhoda. I
have faith in your sincerity and purity of
teaching. Don’t consider anything, except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
how I can please Heaven best. I don’t
want to please myself so much, as not to
disgrace my calling.’</p>

<p>‘If you ask my advice, Fred, I can only
give it in the words of your favourite
Shakespeare:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">“To thine own self, be true!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It follows, as the night the day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou canst not then be false to any man.”’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘Be true to myself!’ mused Frederick
Walcheren. ‘Yes, Rhoda, you are right!
That must be the only true test of any
man’s conduct.’</p>

<p>‘Be true to the divinity that is in you,
Fred. If <i>you</i> feel—if your soul—your
very self feels that you will live an
honester and better life by leaving the
Church—a life nearer God, and more in
accordance with the nature which He has
given you—then don’t go by what any
priest, or Church, or law says, but be a
law to yourself—and act like not only a
Christian, but <i>a man</i>, with free thoughts,
and free aspirations, and a God-given right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
to regulate his own life as he may see
best for himself and others.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you little heretic!’ said Frederick,
laughing, ‘what would they have done to
you a few centuries ago if you had been
overheard uttering such blasphemies! You
would have been condemned to be burnt
at the stake!’</p>

<p>‘Should I?’ retorted Rhoda. ‘Well,
I should not think much of a religion that
could do that!’</p>

<p>‘They both did it,’ replied Frederick,
‘the Protestants as well as the Catholics!
Everyone who differed from them in
opinion, had to pay the penalty of their
rashness.’</p>

<p>‘Then I shouldn’t have thought much
of either of them,’ said the girl. ‘Fred!
religion was meant to bring us nearer God,
not farther from Him. The Church is not
God, the priests are not God, the Bible,
prayer—all these—are only so many helps to
bring us nearer Him. Why think about
what <i>they</i> will say then. Think only what
God will say, and He speaks to you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
through your own conscience, and not
through your fellow-men.’</p>

<p>‘Rhoda, you astound me,’ exclaimed
her companion; ‘where have you learned
all this wisdom? You used not to talk
to me like this when we knew each
other before. Who has taught you so
much? With whom have you been associating?’</p>

<p>The girl looked down and reddened.</p>

<p>‘With no one but myself,’ she answered
gently. ‘I have been very much alone.
You see, I have been too much ashamed to
go amongst the other girls. But I think I
have learned a great deal from my little
baby. He came, you know, Fred, when I
was so very unhappy and despairing, and
he seemed like a little messenger of God
to me, so sweet and innocent and sinless,
and yet, all mine, who was so wicked and
ungrateful and repining. I suppose I
ought to have been very much ashamed
of him, but I never was. He seemed to
say to me, when he looked up in my face
and smiled, whilst I was weeping over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
him: “Yes, you have been very wicked,
and you are very unhappy, but here I am,
you see, sent straight from God to comfort
you. And, if you will be good for the
future, He will let me stay to make up to
you for all you have lost.” It was silly of
me, wasn’t it? to fancy such things, but
they comforted me, and so I go on fancying
them, even to this day. And baby has
seemed to make me think of God and
bring me nearer to Him than I have ever
been before. And oh! Fred,’ she continued,
bursting out into a sudden enthusiasm,
which she had never permitted
herself to exhibit before, ‘he is such a
darling little creature, you can’t think, so
fat and strong, and he can toddle all over
the place by himself. He was fourteen
months old yesterday. But I forgot,’
said Rhoda, suddenly checking herself; ‘I
oughtn’t to mention him to you now. It
will hurt you to remember it. Please forgive
me, Fred. I should not have done
it. It was a mistake.’</p>

<p>She looked at him, and, to her pity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
surprise, saw that tears were standing in
his eyes.</p>

<p>‘Talk to me just as you will, Rhoda,’
he said, ‘I love to hear you. How can I
say I am glad you have this little child to
comfort you, when I remember all the
shame and sorrow he has brought you,
and of which I am the cause? Yet, perhaps,
God knows best, and sent him with
a holy purpose. May He bless you both,
and reward you for your sweet, womanly
goodness to me. I cannot. Will you
tell me some more about him?’ he added,
humbly.</p>

<p>‘Why, yes, of course, Fred, if you care
to hear it! But mother says, if I once
begin talking of my black crow, as she
calls him, I never stop.’</p>

<p>‘Is he so very dark, then?’ asked the
young man, gazing at the girl’s golden
hair.</p>

<p>‘Oh! yes, not a bit like me, thank
goodness! His eyes are like black velvet,
and so is his hair. I am glad of that.
He reminds me of you! And he has six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
teeth, and eats crusts like anything! And
he can say “muvver” and “danny” quite
well!’</p>

<p>‘Nothing else?’ inquired Frederick,
wistfully.</p>

<p>‘Only “sugar”,’ replied Rhoda, looking
at him as much as to say, ‘How can I
teach him of a father he will never
know?’</p>

<p>‘And your mother,’ continued Walcheren,
‘did she pronounce Anathema
Maranatha on me, Rhoda, for the shabby
trick I played you?’</p>

<p>‘She was very, very angry at first, Fred.
She could hardly help being that; but she
has been an angel of goodness to me all
through. And she is really very fond of
Freddy, now!’</p>

<p>‘You called him after me!’ cried the
young man, eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Was I wrong? Are you angry?’ said
Rhoda, colouring from cheek to brow.</p>

<p>‘Angry! No! why should I be, only
you might have called the poor bantling
after a better man.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> did not think so,’ said Rhoda, simply.</p>

<p>There was a long pause between them
before the young man rose to take his
leave. How strange it seemed that, all at
once, he had become timid in the presence
of this young girl who had such faith in him.
They had been so much to each other,
and now they were so little; such a wide
gulf separated their interests and lives.
And yet there was one tiny link between
them which neither could ever forget.</p>

<p>‘It is getting late! I must go,’ said
Frederick, as he stood up and held out his
hand to her.</p>

<p>Rhoda took it in a lifeless manner.
She dared not press it—it was the
hand of a priest, not of her lover. Yet,
not to press it, and when he was in
trouble, seemed so hard. But she dropped
it instead, as if her own had no power
to retain it.</p>

<p>‘Good-night!’ she murmured. ‘God
bless you, Frederick, and help you out
of this new trouble. I shall go back to
Luton by the first train to-morrow.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>He longed to say ‘Don’t,’ but he dared
not. Whatever lay in the future for him,
he must not say a word more than necessary
to her, whilst he wore those robes.
So he said ‘Good-night!’ also, in an awkward
manner, as if he were ashamed to
part with her so coldly, and turned away.
But, as he reached the door, he halted for
a moment to add,—‘You have done me
so much good, I feel quite hopeful since I
have seen you! God bless you!’ and,
nodding kindly, went his way.</p>

<p>And when he had disappeared, Rhoda
sank down on her knees, and thanked God
that she had seen him again, and that he
still thought of and regarded her as a
friend.</p>

<p>When Henry Hindes left the presence of
Frederick Walcheren, he hailed a hansom
and ordered the driver to take him back
to Hampstead. He was not only unable
to stand or walk, he was incapable of
thinking. He lolled back in the hansom
like a dead body, and had barely strength
to alight at his own door. The servant
who admitted him, used as he had been
to see his master look ill of late, ran down
to the lower regions to say that he believed
‘The guv’ner was dying, he seemed
that bad.’ Hannah, who, having heard
his entrance, came smiling out into the
hall to meet him, was struck by his altered
appearance, and exclaimed,—</p>

<p>‘What is the matter with you? Have
you been ill? Are you in any pain?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>To all which, Hindes only said in
answer,—</p>

<p>‘Be quiet! Hold your tongue! Am
I destined never to have any peace?’</p>

<p>He pushed his way past her to the
library, where she followed him.</p>

<p>‘How can you be so unkind and ungrateful,
Henry? I was coming to tell
you a piece of good news, that I knew
you would be glad to hear.’</p>

<p>‘Good news! What good news can
there ever be for me again?’</p>

<p>‘I believe you will think it the very
best you could receive. Doctor Sewell
has been here this afternoon, and brought
Mr Lyndhurst with him. They made a
thorough examination of Wally, and Mr
Lyndhurst says we may set our minds
completely at rest with regard to his spine
being permanently affected. It received
a great shock by the concussion, but all
the dangerous symptoms have abated, and
I am to let him get up for a few hours to-morrow,
and so gradually put him on his
feet again. Now, isn’t that good news?’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
Hannah said sweetly, as she put her hand
upon her husband’s arm.</p>

<p>But Hindes did not smile, nor look at her.
He jerked his arm roughly from her detaining
clasp instead, and, sinking down
upon a sofa, murmured,—</p>

<p>‘Too late! too late!’</p>

<p>‘Too late!’ exclaimed his wife, in a tone
of surprise, ‘what do you mean, Henry?
Too late to have our dear child restored to
us, safe and sound again. I thought that
was what you were praying for, with myself.
I thought the news would make you
wild with joy. What are you thinking of?’</p>

<p>‘Just what I say! I am thankful for the
child’s sake, of course, but the news comes
too late for me. My secret is known,
Hannah! I have betrayed myself. The
bloodhounds of justice are on my track.’</p>

<p>‘Good God!’ she said under her breath,
‘how did it happen? To whom did you
speak? What made you do it?’</p>

<p>‘My evil genius, I suppose,’ replied
Hindes, grovelling on the sofa. ‘I could
not bear the misery and the suspense any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
longer. It was burning into my soul like
a red-hot iron, and I thought, if I confessed
it, I might find consolation. So I went
into a Roman Catholic confessional one
day last week, and told my story to the
priest. And who do you suppose he
turned out to be?’</p>

<p>‘How can I tell? I know no priests.’</p>

<p>‘Frederick Walcheren!’</p>

<p>‘Frederick Walcheren!’ cried his wife;
‘but how came he to be in a confessional?’</p>

<p>‘He <i>is</i> a priest! He entered the Church,
it seems, after—after—you know what!
And I happened to enter his confessional!
Was it not the irony of Fate? The finger
of Heaven, or the devil tracking me to my
destruction?’</p>

<p>‘But, Henry, the secrets of the confessional
are sacred! I know so much! It
was most unfortunate that you should have
committed such an error as to confess your
sin to <i>him</i>. But he cannot make any use
of his knowledge. So far, you are safe!’</p>

<p>‘But that is not the worst of it, Hannah!
He recognised my voice and, as I was leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
the accursed place, he showed his face
at the open door. It made me dread the
worst. I thought he might find means to
let others learn what he had, or perhaps
reveal it altogether. You never know
what these Roman Catholics may do.
They have no honour!’</p>

<p>‘Don’t blame others, Henry,’ interposed
Hannah, gently, ‘whilst you are blameworthy
yourself. Remember how deeply
you have wronged this man. Yet, Mr
Walcheren was always a gentleman and a
man of honour, and I do not believe he
would reveal a secret, however terrible,
that had come to his knowledge through
such a channel.’</p>

<p>‘I wish I had thought the same. I wish
I had consulted you before,’ groaned her
husband, ‘but I feared the worst, and it
weighed so on my mind that I determined
to visit him privately, and learn what he
intended to do. When I asked him, he
said, as you do, that he was forbidden, under
the most heavy penalties, to repeat anything
that he might hear during his office<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
as confessor. If I had only been content
with that. But his manner made me feel
secure, and I wanted to make myself look
as little guilty as possible in his eyes, so I
told him the story over again, and then—’</p>

<p>‘Well, what then, Henry? Was there
any harm in that?’ inquired Hannah.</p>

<p>‘I have d—d myself by it, that’s all!’
exclaimed Hindes, despairingly. ‘I had
hardly finished when he told me that,
although secrets told under the seal of
confession were inviolate, we were not in
a confessional at that moment, and it lay
within his discretionary powers to make
what use of my revelation he chose.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! Henry, Henry!’ cried Hannah,
‘what have you done? What misery and
disgrace have you not brought upon us
all?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, that’s right,’ he answered roughly;
‘think of the children and yourself before
me. And it’s all your fault, from beginning
to end. Who was it urged me to confess
my sins and obtain forgiveness for
them? Who was it said that, if I humiliated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
myself, Heaven might have mercy on Wally
and give us back his health in exchange?’</p>

<p>‘And so He has!’ said Hannah, joyfully.
‘He <i>has</i> accepted the painful effort you
have made, Henry, and rewarded it by
giving us this fresh hope of the boy’s recovery.
Oh! my poor husband! have I
been harsh to you? I did not mean it! I
was only shocked to think of the danger
you ran! But have no fear, dearest! I
feel sure that God, who put it into your
heart to confess, will not let it lead you to
public disgrace. Frederick Walcheren will
not betray your secret. I am sure of it!
Let <i>me</i> go to him, Henry, and plead to him
for mercy and forbearance in the name of
myself and my little children. I feel certain
he will not refuse me, if it were only
for dear Jenny’s sake, and my great love
for her.’</p>

<p>‘No, no!’ said Hindes, hoarsely; ‘you
must do no such thing! You don’t know
him. He would spurn you from him. A
woman cannot realise a man’s feelings in
such a matter. He loved her—he must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
feel like a wild beast deprived of his prey.
He would tread on you, or anyone who
stood in his path. He is thirsting for his
revenge! He told me so, and when I
craved him for mercy in your name and
the children’s, he only asked what mercy
I had shown him. Hannah! it is useless
to ignore the fact. My doom is fixed!
If it is not the gallows, it is public and
utter disgrace.’</p>

<p>All the woman rose in Hannah’s breast
at these words, and the man before her
was one to be protected and solaced and
thought for.</p>

<p>‘It shall be neither, my dearest,’ she
answered firmly; ‘only trust to me. I
have pondered over the difficulties that
might happen in your case, Henry, and I
think I have found a way out of them.
You are tired and worn out with misery
and suspense, my poor love. Let me
think for you. You must go to your
room now, and try to rest. I will bring
you some dinner myself, for you mustn’t
let the servants see you in this state. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
will sit up to-night, and get your clothes
ready, and pack your portmanteau, and
to-morrow, instead of going to the city,
you shall take the train for Liverpool, and
the first steamer for the Argentine Republic.
<i>There</i> you will be safe from English
laws, and pursuit will be useless. As
soon as you are fairly off, I will wind up
your affairs, and join you with the children.
Trust everything to me. Only
look after your own safety.’</p>

<p>Henry Hindes raised his tear-stained
face from the sofa cushions, and stared at
his wife.</p>

<p>‘<i>You!</i>’ he exclaimed, wonderingly.
‘<i>You</i> will undertake to do all this? But
you have never been used to business in
your life, Hannah. How do you propose
to take such a burden on your shoulders,
and to accomplish it?’</p>

<p>‘My love for you will teach me, Henry,’
she said simply. ‘Besides, do not think
I am so presumptuous as to suppose I can
do it all by myself. My uncle, Bailey, is
an excellent man of business, remember,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
and our solicitor will help me. The business
may be sold something under value,
perhaps, but I promise I will consent to
nothing rash, and all I shall strive for is
to realise the bulk of your money, and
transmit it to you in the Argentine, that
you may make a home for me and the
children there.’</p>

<p>‘But it will be exile for life, Hannah.
I shall never be able to show my face in
England again, remember.’</p>

<p>‘I only remember that I would rather
spend the rest of my life in the desert
with you, Henry, than live without you
anywhere,’ replied Hannah, with a watery
smile.</p>

<p>‘And you can feel thus for <i>me</i>—a murderer!’
said Hindes, wonderingly.</p>

<p>But she laid her hand upon his mouth.</p>

<p>‘I will not let you call yourself by that
name, Henry,’ she said. ‘I never think
of you as such. I begin to believe, as
you have sometimes told me, that it was
the effects of an unfortunate accident.’</p>

<p>‘God bless you! God bless you!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
cried the wretched man, bursting into
tears, as she took him in her arms and
laid his weary head upon her faithful
bosom.</p>

<p>They talked over the plan she had suggested
a little longer, and then Hannah
persuaded him to take some refreshment
and to go upstairs to his own room and
rest. But, left alone again, all his fears
returned. The presence of his wife had a
magnetic effect upon him, but, as soon as
she had withdrawn, he became a prey to
the phantoms raised by his uneasy conscience.
He could not rest in his bed,
but kept starting up, fancying that he
heard voices in the hall, or on the stairs,
people inquiring for him, demanding to
see and speak with him, forcing their way
up to his bedroom, whilst Hannah tried in
vain to bar their ingress.</p>

<p>She, on the contrary, though feeling a
little nervous and uneasy at the story her
husband had brought home, fancied she
saw a happier future before them than she
had dared to hope for. It was better for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
them all, she thought, that matters had
come to a crisis, and they were compelled
to leave the country, where they could
never again live in any comfort.</p>

<p>Once Henry was out of England, she
would seek an interview with Mr Walcheren,
and ask his forbearance for the
sake of her poor children, who would have
their innocent lives stained by the publicity
of their father’s crime. Once her
husband was safe, she was sure she could
arrange everything to her own satisfaction,
and, when she joined him, they would begin
a new life, unshadowed by fear or deceit.</p>

<p>She sat down quite cheerfully to her
dinner, at which the master so seldom
appeared now that his absence was nothing
remarkable, and succeeded in making
the attendants think that there was
nothing more wrong than usual. After
dinner, she carried a cup of coffee up to
her husband with her own hands, but
found him in an unaccountably nervous
condition, considering how hopeful he had
been when she parted with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>‘Who is that downstairs?’ he asked,
glancing fearfully at the door by which
she had entered, as if he thought someone
would steal in after her. ‘I heard
voices. Whom have you been talking
to?’</p>

<p>‘No one, dear, except the servants,’ replied
his wife. ‘I met Ellen on the stairs
just now coming from Wally’s room, and
she says the little rogue is so free from
pain to-night that he has been romping
over the bed.’</p>

<p>‘No, no! Not that!’ replied Hindes,
fretfully. ‘There was someone else. Don’t
try to deceive me. A man’s voice. I
heard it distinctly.’</p>

<p>‘Why should I deceive you, Henry?’
said Hannah, mildly. ‘I assure you, you
are mistaken. I have been quite alone
since you came upstairs.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe it! You’re lying to
me!’ he answered, glaring at her with
demoniacal eyes.</p>

<p>She was used to his vagaries, and found
it best not to argue against them. So she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
put the bedclothes over him carefully again,
and, stooping down, kissed him, and bade
him go to sleep.</p>

<p>‘I shall come up very early to-night,
you know, dear, in order to arrange your
things, and, if you wish it, I will rouse you
then, but it will be much better if you will
try and sleep. You said just now, you
know, that you would be good, and let me
manage everything for you—and so I will.
Only try and rest, for you will have so
much fatigue to-morrow.’</p>

<p>Her soothing had its usual effect on him,
and he lay down and closed his eyes, and
murmured something about not deserving
to have so good a wife, which was
eminently true.</p>

<p>Hannah occupied herself a little about
the adjoining apartment, until she thought
he had dropped off again, and then went
softly downstairs again. What was her
amazement to be met at the foot by one of
her servants, with the intelligence that a
gentleman was waiting in the drawing-room
to see her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>‘A gentleman!’ she echoed; ‘what is
his name, James?’</p>

<p>‘He did not give his name, ma’am. He
asked for the master first, but I said I
thought he had gone up to bed, and then
he said he would wait and see. I think
he’s some sort of a priest, if you please,
ma’am; at least, he looks like it.’</p>

<p><i>Some sort of a priest!</i> Hannah’s heart
stood still at the words, but she resolved
to know what he came for. Perhaps it was
Frederick Walcheren himself, and, in that
case, she would plead her own cause to
him. Without a moment’s delay, she
passed down the corridor, and entered the
drawing-room. It <i>was</i> Walcheren who
stood before her! Altered as he was by
his dress, and the terrible experience he
had passed through, she recognised him at
once. But he seemed rather taken aback
at her appearance. He had evidently not
expected to see her, and he neither came
forward to meet her nor offered his hand.
As for Hannah, she stood trembling before
him, as if he had been a judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>‘Mrs Hindes, I believe,’ began Frederick,
courteously, ‘but I am sorry they troubled
you, madam. It was your husband I came
to see. I have a little business with him.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, I know. He has told me,’
replied poor Hannah. ‘We have no
secrets from each other, Mr Walcheren,
and Henry has related to me the whole
account of his seeing you in the confessional
and visiting you at your private
residence afterwards.’</p>

<p>‘He has told you his motives and what
has passed between us?’ said the young
man, in astonishment.</p>

<p>‘Everything, sir, and I have known
it from the beginning. Oh, Mr Walcheren,’
she went on rapidly, ‘I was going to see
you about it. I wanted to plead to you
for mercy for my poor children and myself.
I have no excuses to make for my unhappy
husband. How could I have, when
Jenny’—here Hannah’s tears commenced
to flow and her utterance became choked
with her sobs—‘when she was my very,
very dearest friend? No one mourned her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
loss more than I did, and to think—to
think— But my wretched husband has
lived in hell since that miserable day. He
has never known one happy moment. If
any man ever repented a sin, he has done
his. Can you not find it in your heart, Mr
Walcheren, to show him a little mercy?
It would be very noble of you if you
would. Henry shall never annoy you by
his presence again. We are intending to
leave the country, never to return. Only,
if you could find it in your heart to spare
him—to forgive as you hope to be forgiven—for
the sake of his little children, sir—’</p>

<p>She attempted to fall at his feet, but he
raised her.</p>

<p>‘Mrs Hindes, you greatly distress me,’
he said. ‘I did not expect, nor wish to see
you when I came here to-night. I had
but one object in doing so—’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes,’ she interposed, ‘I know it.
To tell him to prepare for the worst—to
say you must, in justice to yourself and
<i>her</i> dear memory, let the law take its
course—and if you had only waited a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
few days, I should have got him out of
your reach.’</p>

<p>‘But, indeed, you are mistaken,’ replied
Walcheren, ‘that was not my intention.
Of course, I don’t pretend to deny the
awful feelings for revenge which his story
evoked in my breast against him. I loved—I
loved <i>her</i> very dearly, Mrs Hindes—’</p>

<p>‘Oh, my darling, my darling,’ broke out
Hannah.</p>

<p>‘And you loved her too,’ he proceeded,
tenderly, ‘and must understand what I
felt on first hearing the awful story of her
death. But that was my first impression.
I have reflected since—a friend of mine has
been probing my heart and motives for
me, and setting things generally in a
clearer light, and the conclusion I have
arrived at is, that I shall do nothing more
in the matter. I will bury my resentment
in my lost wife’s grave, and, though you
must feel that I could never see, nor speak
to your husband again, yet he is safe from
me. His secret is also safe, as far as I
am concerned. My lips shall never disclose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
it. I came here to-night to tell
him so.’</p>

<p>‘How—how can we ever thank you,’
whispered Hannah, through her tears.</p>

<p>‘Your thanks are not due to me, but to
my friend. If she had not led my thoughts
the right way, they would not have gone
there by themselves. Set your mind at
rest, therefore, Mrs Hindes. The matter
is done with. Will you tell your husband
so from me?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! gladly, thankfully, Mr Walcheren.
You have saved him. You have saved
us all. May God bless you and your friend
for it!’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ he returned quietly, as he
bowed and walked out into the hall.</p>

<p>Hannah followed him there.</p>

<p>‘Do you go back by the station?’ she
inquired. ‘May I send you home in the
carriage?’</p>

<p>‘No thank you!’ he answered, shuddering
at the idea of using anything that
belonged to Henry Hindes. ‘I am a
poor man now, and not used to such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
luxuries. The station will suit me
best.’</p>

<p>And then, without any greeting less
formal than an inclination of his head,
Frederick Walcheren passed out of the
hall door and went on his way. Hannah
guessed the reason. Dearly as she had
loved the dead girl, he could not persuade
himself to shake hands with the wife of her
murderer. Perhaps it was best so. Frederick
Walcheren would now pass out of
their lives for ever.</p>

<p>Henry Hindes, with his ears quickened
by fear, had heard the opening and shutting
of the front door, and the slight conversation
passing in the hall. He had
sprung out of his bed to listen, and crouched
behind his bedroom door. He had recognised
Frederick Walcheren’s voice, and
caught the word ‘station’ twice repeated.
Why had he come? What was he there
for? And what ‘station’ could he be
speaking off? There was but one solution
of the mystery in the morbid ideas of
Henry Hindes. The conscience that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
makes cowards of us all, had transformed
him into a trembling poltroon, incapable
of judging or arguing. Frederick Walcheren
was in The Old Hall, and there
could be but one reason for his coming
there—to publicly denounce him as a
murderer—to have him arrested and
dragged to prison—to pursue him until
he landed him on the scaffold, and saw the
rope pulled that should hang him by the
neck till he was dead. But he shouldn’t—he
shouldn’t—he had means by which
he could escape it yet. Why didn’t Hannah
come up to tell him what was going on?
Could she be in league with his tormentors,
after all the protestations she had made to
him an hour ago? Perhaps—it was not
unlikely—women were such arch deceivers,
they would smile in your face one moment,
and draw a knife across your throat the
next. Well! he would escape her too!—no
one should triumph over his public fall.
As he thought thus, Henry Hindes crept
round to his chest of drawers and groped
in the dark for the lock, which he opened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
with the keys he kept beneath his pillow.
He found a bottle there—a bottle the
shape of which he knew full well, for had
it not been his daily and nightly companion
for many months past? He knew it, and it
knew him, he said to himself, with a sardonic
smile, that was half a sneer, and they
had never known each other better, nor
valued each other more, than they would
do that night. But as he was about to
re-enter his bed, he remembered his little
Wally lying in the next room, and thought
he would like to take a look at him first.
So he crept into the adjoining chamber,
where the boy lay fast asleep, with one
arm, thinned by sickness, thrown above his
head. Hindes put his lips reverently on
the little arm and then softly lay down
beside his child.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hannah was feeling almost
too thankful for words. How happy she
would make poor Henry when he next
woke. No need for packing up in a hurry
now, and slinking out of England like a
condemned criminal. He might stay on in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
safety till he had wound up his own affairs,
and could start for the new land surrounded
by his family.</p>

<p>‘What a relief! what a relief!’ she
thought, as she went upstairs. ‘I shall
love and pray for the name of Walcheren
to the last day of my life!’</p>

<p>She peeped into Wally’s chamber first!
There lay her child flushed with sleep, and
beside him, with one arm thrown round the
boy’s body, was her husband, white and
weary looking, but apparently sound asleep
as well.</p>

<p>‘Poor fellow!’ mused Hannah, as she
stood and gazed at him. ‘He is utterly
worn-out. I wonder what made him fancy
getting into bed with the child. Perhaps
it was to make sure that I should not come
up without waking him. Henry dear,’
she said aloud, as she touched the sleeper
gently. ‘Henry! I have such good news,
such lovely news for you. Our worst
troubles are over, darling! Wake up and
hear what I have to tell you!’</p>

<p>She stooped and kissed his cold cheek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
as she spoke, and the truth was instantly
revealed to her. Her husband slept so
deeply that he would never wake in this
world again.</p>

<p>At the very moment when his doubts
and fears were to be set at rest, he had
taken the law into his own hands and gone
from this sphere to work out his life’s
punishment in another.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>


<p>A few days after this occurrence, Rhoda
Berry was seated in her mother’s cottage
at Luton, plaiting straw. It was interesting
to watch her deft fingers weaving and
interweaving the fine splits of straw, until
they formed a plait as delicate as that of a
woman’s hair. The operation appeared as
intricate as that of lace-making, until the
ends were worked in and the Grecian pattern
became visible.</p>

<p>At her feet sat, or rather tumbled, her
baby boy, amusing himself also with the
ends of straw his mother dropped. Mrs
Berry was bustling in and out of the little
kitchen meanwhile, occupied with her domestic
duties, and discussing, with some
vehemence, the contents of a letter she had
received that morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>‘I can’t think why you object to the idea,
Rhoda,’ she said. ‘Here’s a fine opportunity
for us both to live like ladies again,
and you almost turn up your nose at it!
My brother Will is not one to go from his
word, and you heard what he said, that
since his wife is dead and he is so lonely,
with his only son at sea, he would be grateful
if you and I would take up our abode
at King’s Farm for the rest of our lives.
I know what that means, Rhoda! That
he intends to leave all he has to us. Will
is not the fellow to invite two women to his
house like that, and then leave them to
starve. And this is next door to starvation.
It’s drudging from morning to night, and
making a penny how and when we can.
And my brother keeps two house-servants,
fancy that! And I should have the management
of them both!’</p>

<p>‘Mother, dear! why don’t you go, and
leave me here? I am quite capable of
earning my own living, and you know the
obstacle to my going to King’s Farm.
How could I take my baby there, to disgrace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
my uncle and all his family? But it
is a shame that my fault should be the
means of keeping you from a good home.
Do write and accept this offer, mother, and
I shall do well enough in Luton, never
fear. Why! I’m earning thirty shillings
a week now, even in the worst times. I
shall do well enough. That’s more than
sufficient for me and baby. But I’ll never
take him into another man’s house to be
scorned and pointed at.’</p>

<p>‘Now, Rhoda, what nonsense you talk!’
exclaimed Mrs Berry, impatiently. ‘As if
anything would tempt me to part from you
and the little crow! As if you hadn’t suffered
enough without your mother forsaking you,
poor girl! No, I’m not made of such stuff
as that! Either we go to King’s Farm
together, or we don’t go at all. But I must
say I would like to see the roses back in
your cheeks, Rhoda! You used to have
such a fine colour before you went up to
London. It would do you and the little
crow such a world of good, too, to be running
about the green fields and lanes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
Somersetshire, and to live amongst the
cows and sheep and chickens. You’d be
another woman in a fortnight.’</p>

<p>‘I know I should, mother, but, you see,
this is one of the good things of this life
that I have put away from me by my sin.
It is part of the penance God has called
upon me to perform. And that I must
prevent your taking advantage of Uncle
Will’s offer, also, makes it doubly hard to
bear.’</p>

<p>‘Why, you don’t suppose I could have
any pleasure in it all whilst my only girl
was moping down here by herself, do you?
It’s that bothering little crow that sticks in
the way. Suppose we get rid of him,
Rhoda?’ said Mrs Berry, playfully. ‘Let’s
drown him in the water-butt. No one will
be any the wiser, and it would be a blessing
to get rid of him, wouldn’t it, now?’</p>

<p>She expected to see Rhoda shake her
head sadly at the proposal, but she was
not prepared to see her catch her child up
and press it passionately to her bosom,
whilst she burst into a flood of tears. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
was so unlike her patient, humble, quiet
Rhoda, that Mrs Berry was fairly taken
aback.</p>

<p>‘Why, my dear, my dear,’ she cried,
‘what is the matter? What have I said
to upset you so? I was only in fun,
Rhoda. Surely you know that? I
wouldn’t harm a hair of the child’s head
for all the wealth of the Indies.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, mother, yes; I know it,’ replied
the girl, still sobbing. ‘Only, I feel, I
foresee that my poor bairn will be my
curse and yours, perhaps, through life.
The trouble and the expense are nothing—nothing.
But it’s the shame that is so
hard to bear, not only for myself, but for
you and him, poor lamb, when he is old
enough to understand.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, Rhoda, it’s what was prophesied
long ago—the sins of the fathers
being visited on the children, but you
mustn’t make too much of it. You’ve
had your share of fretting, goodness
knows! and you’ll kill yourself if you get
no rest from it. You’re not over strong,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
my girl, as it is. I’ve watched your cheeks
grow thinner for many a day past, and it’s
worried me more than enough. This Mr
Walcheren is as much dead to you, Rhoda,
as if he was in his grave, where I’m sure
I wish to goodness he had been before he
had ever met you, and so you must try not to
think of him, and that’s why I’d like to see
a few more miles put between you. It
does you no good to live so near London.’</p>

<p>‘Mother,’ said the girl, as she dried her
wet eyes, ‘if you imagine for a moment
that I think of Fred in any other light
than that of another woman’s husband,
you are very much mistaken. If he were
free to marry to-morrow, he wouldn’t ask
<i>me</i> to be his wife.’</p>

<p>(‘More shame for him,’ interpolated Mrs
Berry.)</p>

<p>‘He is grieving too much to dream of
marrying again, even if he were in the
world. His heart is buried in his wife’s
grave.’</p>

<p>‘More shame for him,’ repeated her
mother, ‘and with that poor little child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
running about without a father to his
name.’</p>

<p>‘Such a thing has never entered my
imagination for a minute,’ continued
Rhoda. ‘I am glad that we are friends,
and proud that he should consider me
worthy to give him advice, but there will
never be anything more between us. How
could there be?’</p>

<p>‘I understood he had some idea of leaving
the Church.’</p>

<p>‘He alluded to it, mother, but I do not
suppose he will have the courage to carry
it out. It would take the spirit of a hero,
or a martyr, to brave the sneers and contempt
and abuse of the world for taking
such a step. And Frederick was never
very strong-minded. He must have altered
greatly since I knew him if he has the
courage of his own opinions.’</p>

<p>‘He’s not like you, then, my dear, who
have, I verily believe, the courage of a
lion. But I mustn’t stop chattering any
longer, or we shall have no dinner to-day.
But think over Uncle Will’s proposal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
again, Rhoda, before you finally make up
your mind. He’s too good a man to
throw a girl’s misfortune in her teeth.
And we shall never get such a chance
again—never.’</p>

<p>Rhoda smiled faintly, but she shook her
head all the same. Never had her sin
stared her so unpleasantly in the face
before. To be disgraced for Frederick’s
sake—to bear her shame silently and alone—to
have to toil through life to maintain
her child—all this she had realised long
ago, and made up her mind to bear courageously.</p>

<p>But to stand in the way of her mother’s
well-doing—to have to see her toiling, even
to old age, because of her daughter’s fault—to
know that she stood between her and
comfort, between her and the love of her
own family, between her and rest, and a
home more fitted to her position than the
one they had occupied since Rhoda’s father
died—<i>this</i> was the bitterest portion of the
cup she had been called upon to drink.</p>

<p>When Mrs Berry had left her, the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
girl wept long and bitterly, as she tried to
decide whether it might not be her duty to
bear the shame and contempt which would
be her share if she took her child amongst
her mother’s relations. It was hard to
contemplate. She had hoped the worst
was over—that, the inhabitants of Luton
having agreed to overlook her misfortune,
there would be no more unpleasantness to
encounter, but if it was to be for her
mother’s sake—her dear mother, who had
clung to her through everything—she would
pass through the fire a second time. It
was less than she deserved, she knew that,
and, if needful, she would be brave and
bear it.</p>

<p>She dried her eyes again, and turned to
recommence her work. But the baby had
got hold of her plait of straw, which had
fallen to the ground, and taken advantage
of his mother’s abstraction to undo half of
it, and spoil the rest.</p>

<p>‘Oh, baby, baby!’ she cried. ‘How
naughty you are. You have spoiled poor
mother’s work.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>As she spoke, and lifted the child in her
arms, a shadow darkened the threshold of
the open door, and, glancing up, she encountered
the eyes of Frederick Walcheren
fixed upon her. Rhoda rose in the utmost
confusion. She did not know what to say
to him. She was as timid of being caught
with the child in her arms as if Frederick
had never heard of its existence. The
first words she stammered were,—</p>

<p>‘<i>You!</i> Oh, why have you come down
here?’</p>

<p>‘Expressly to see you, Rhoda,’ he replied,
‘seeing that I know no one else in
Luton. And so this is the little chap, is it?
He is a sturdy fellow. And his eyes and
hair are very dark, Rhoda.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she answered in a low voice.</p>

<p>She could not understand why, under
their present circumstances, Frederick
should care to allude to the likeness between
her child and himself. It jarred upon
her. She put the baby down on the ground
and began plaiting the straw again.</p>

<p>‘Mayn’t I come in? Are you not going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
to ask me to sit down? I am rather tired,’
said Frederick Walcheren, ‘and I have a
good many things to talk to you about.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! yes, forgive me,’ she replied, as
she rose and set a chair for her visitor at
the opposite side of the little room.</p>

<p>‘Are you very much surprised to see
me here, Rhoda?’ he commenced.</p>

<p>‘Yes! very! It is so unexpected. I
don’t know what mother will say,’ replied
the girl, in an uncertain tone.</p>

<p>‘I hope I may be able to relieve her
mind. But you haven’t looked at me,
Rhoda.’</p>

<p>She raised her eyes then, and gave a
little exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>‘Oh! what is changed in you? What
have you done to yourself? You look so
different!’</p>

<p>‘Cannot you see? I am in plain
clothes.’</p>

<p>She recognised the alteration then. He
wore a rough suit of grey tweed, such as
gentlemen sport in the country, with a
coloured tie, and a round hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>‘You have discarded your cassock!
What does this mean? Have you—can
you really have left the Church?’</p>

<p>‘I have indeed, Rhoda! Whatever my
friends or enemies may think of my determination,
I have resolved to follow the
dictates of my own conscience, and be
accountable to no one for my actions
except God.’</p>

<p>The soft rose colour mounted to the
girl’s cheeks with pleasure.</p>

<p>‘I am so glad,’ she whispered.</p>

<p>‘So you ought to be, for it is all your
doing. Ever since I saw you last, I have
been unable to get those words out of my
ears:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">“To thine own self be true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It follows, as the night, the day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou canst not then be false to any man.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I was untrue to myself, Rhoda, when I
allowed my friends to persuade me to become
a priest, but, at the time, I was in no
fit state to judge of anything. But I think
I might have remained in it for ever, had
it not been for your encouragement and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
brave advice. I suppose I shall make a
great scandal amongst my brethren by
leaving it, but they will not make it more
public than necessary. The churches
always hush up anything that does not
redound to their credit. But I am
willing, in this case, to take all the blame
on myself.’</p>

<p>‘And what are you going to do, Fred?
You will not prosecute that unfortunate
man, I hope,’ said Rhoda, wistfully.</p>

<p>‘Ah! Rhoda, there is no need to do it!
The temptation has been removed from
my way. He is dead.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Dead!</i>’ she echoed, wonderingly.</p>

<p>‘Yes. It is true. After I left you
that evening, I found your persuasions and
arguments had taken such hold upon my
mind that I resolved to go on to this
man’s dwelling at once and tell him he
had nothing to fear from me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Fred, how good of you!’ cried
the girl, with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>‘I did so, therefore, and saw the man’s
wife, whom I found knew the whole story,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
and thought I had come to accuse her
husband openly of the murder. I set her
mind at rest on the subject, and she told
me he had determined to leave England the
following day. He had retired to rest, so
I did not attempt to disturb him, knowing
his wife would tell him everything. The
next day I received a letter from her to
say that, on going up to her husband’s
room to communicate the news to him,
she found him lying dead on the same bed
as his little child. She tried to make out
his was an ordinary sudden death, but, at
the coroner’s inquest that followed, I see
they brought it in as suicide. Undoubtedly,
the poor wretch had taken poison under
the fear of detection. I had heard he was
greatly addicted to the use of morphia.
Remorse had driven him out of his mind.’</p>

<p>‘And the poor wife and children—what
will become of them?’ asked Rhoda.</p>

<p>‘They have plenty of this world’s goods,
child, with which to make themselves
comfortable, and the peace of mind, let
us hope, will come with time. She has a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
very kind brother and sister-in-law, who
flew to her directly they heard the news of
her husband’s death, and they will doubtless
be her firm friends in the future. And she
has three children, Rhoda, to look to for
comfort. I am very glad of it, for she is
a good woman and wife and mother, and,
I am told, believed in him to the last.’</p>

<p>‘Poor lady,’ sighed Rhoda, ‘how sad
for her to find him worthless of her regard.
The worst thing we can be called upon to
bear is, to find our love has been thrown
away.’</p>

<p>‘As you threw yours away on me,
Rhoda.’</p>

<p>‘No, I didn’t mean that,’ she answered,
colouring. ‘I shouldn’t have said it before
you if I had.’</p>

<p>‘But <i>I</i> mean it, Rhoda. I have been a
scoundrel to you. I never saw it more
plainly than I do to-day, to find you hard
at work, with this child crawling at your
feet.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t speak of it, Fred, please. It is
past. Let the subject be tabooed between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
us. What are your plans? Tell me what
you intend to do?’</p>

<p>‘I am going to leave the country, Rhoda.
I don’t wish to bring more discredit on my
faith and family than I need, so I shall
make my home in a new land, and never
offend their sight or hearing again. I am
penniless, as you know. Every farthing
of my fine fortune has gone into the coffers
of the Church. I can’t say I don’t regret
it, for I do; but I must accept the loss as
part of the penalty of not knowing my
own mind.’</p>

<p>‘Money does not make all the happiness
of this world,’ said Rhoda, softly.</p>

<p>‘No, but a considerable portion of it.
However, least said, in this case, soonest
mended. Failing it, I must work with my
hands for my daily bread, which, perhaps,
will be all the better for me. I shall begin
low, but shall hope to rise by-and-by. An
old chum of mine has lent me sufficient
money to take me out of the country and
settle me down a bit, and I am going
straight to another chum, who has a big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
ranch out in the Rocky Mountains, and
who, I know, will find me some sort of
work to do.’</p>

<p>‘But, Fred—’ began Rhoda, eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Wait a minute, my dear. I have something
more to say to you. I shall have to go,
of course, any way, but you would make me
so much happier if you would go with me.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Go with you!</i>’ exclaimed Rhoda, looking
up with startled eyes.</p>

<p>‘Yes, as my wife, of course. You didn’t
suppose I was brute enough to add an
insult to the wrong I have done you.’</p>

<p>‘But, Fred, I am not worthy,’ cried the
girl, with crimsoned cheeks.</p>

<p>‘Not worthy! Don’t make me feel a
greater villain than I do, by saying such a
thing. Rhoda, dear, I never deceived you.
You know I never made what is called
“love” to you in the old, thoughtless days,
which ended so disastrously for you. I
didn’t love anybody at that time, unless it
was myself and my own selfish pleasures.
I adored my poor wife. I am not afraid to
say that before you, because you are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
like other women. You like a man to
speak the truth, not a lot of lies and
flattery. But, if ever I loved a woman in
my life, you have made me love you. If
ever I felt that anyone was absolutely
necessary to my existence, I feel that of
you. If ever a fellow-creature has been a
true, unselfish, trustworthy friend to me,
it is you; and I am only speaking the plain
truth when I say, if you will come with
me to America and share my rough life
there, you will make me far happier than
I ever expected to be again.’</p>

<p>Rhoda had slipped from her seat and
was kneeling by his side, hiding her face
upon his hands.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my love, my love!’ she sobbed, ‘I
cannot believe it. It is too wonderful for
me to believe. Oh! take me with you as
your servant, your slave, anything, so as I
may remain near you in sickness or health,
to look after your comfort and minister to
your wants.’</p>

<p>But he raised her up and sat her on his
knee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>‘As my slave. Yes!’ he answered as
he kissed her, ‘all wives who love their
husbands become slaves, but a slave that
will be very near my heart, Rhoda—a slave
that shall be honoured above everyone in
my household. Is that a bargain, my dear?
That we shall promise to be true friends
and counsellors to our lives’ end.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! Fred, I am so happy. I never
thought or dreamt that it could come to
this. I should have been content to be
your friend only for ever.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no! you wouldn’t,’ he said, shaking
his head; ‘and if you would, I shouldn’t.
But remember, I am a beggar, Rhoda.
All those magic bank-notes, that procured
us so much pleasure in the old days, are
gone for ever. It is a hard lot I ask you
to share with me. You are marrying a
gentleman who has nothing but the title
to recommend him.’</p>

<p>‘But, Fred, it is not so,’ said the girl;
‘you forget that you made Mr Sinclair invest
five thousand pounds for baby. I
never touched it, darling! I never should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
have touched it during your lifetime. I
told Mr Sinclair so, and it is there for you
to take when you choose. And, though it
is little to what you used to have, still, it is
better than nothing, isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Better than nothing! I should rather
think so! Why, under the circumstances,
it is a fortune. But it is not mine, Rhoda!
It belongs to the little chap there!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Fred, what nonsense! Who gave
it him? Who has a better right to it than
you? Besides, you have given him value
in exchange, twice told.’</p>

<p>‘What is that?’ inquired Frederick.</p>

<p>‘A father,’ she whispered.</p>

<p>At this juncture in bustled Mrs Berry
from the kitchen, bearing a smoking beefsteak
pudding in her hands.</p>

<p>‘Now, Rhoda, my girl, it’s past two.
Where’s the cloth?’ she began, but finished
up with, ‘My gracious! whom have
we got here?’</p>

<p>Rhoda was too excited and happy to
wait for introductions.</p>

<p>‘Mother! mother!’ she cried, springing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
to Mrs Berry’s arms, and nearly upsetting
the pudding altogether, ‘it’s my Fred, and
he’s going to marry me, and we’re going
to the Rocky Mountains together, and oh,
mother! you will be able to go and keep
Uncle Will’s house for him now whilst
we’re away.’</p>

<p>She clung to her mother, sobbing and
laughing at the same time, whilst Mrs
Berry and Frederick Walcheren could only
stand and gaze at one another in astonishment.</p>

<p>‘Rhoda, Rhoda, my dear! be reasonable!’
at last said Frederick, as he took
her hand and tried to pull her away.</p>

<p>‘Reasonable! well, I wish she would!’
exclaimed Mrs Berry; ‘how am I to be
expected to understand all this scrimmage,
when you’ve never had the decency to tell
me the man was in the house? <i>Your</i>
Fred, indeed! Why, I thought your Fred
was a Roman priest. Are you imposing
on me, child? and putting another young
man on me instead of him?’</p>

<p>‘No, no! indeed, mother!’ said Rhoda,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
as she caught up her baby, and prepared
to leave the room. ‘Oh, Fred! explain
the whole thing to mother, and I’ll be back
in a minute.’</p>

<p>She flew upstairs, and spent some time
crying and cooing over her child, and telling
him, amidst her frantic kisses, what
a dear, good father he had, and how
very, very much his mother loved them
both. She bathed her own eyes, too, and
smoothed her golden hair, and descended
to the little parlour, blushing like a rose,
but with eyes beaming with gratitude and
affection.</p>

<p>‘Well, here’s a pretty kettle of fish!’ exclaimed
Mrs Berry, as her daughter appeared;
‘and so you’re to be off to the
United States in another fortnight, and
leave your poor mother to go to King’s
Farm by herself. A nice, dutiful daughter
you are, upon my word!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, mother darling! you know it is the
very thing you would have chosen had you
been given your wish!’ said the girl. ‘It
is sad to part, dear, but it is all for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
best! You will be so happy and comfortable
with Uncle Will, and the next time I
see England,’ she added, in a whisper, ‘I
shall not be ashamed, you know, to go
down and pay you and him a visit.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, my poor lamb!’ said her mother,
looking fondly at her. ‘Thank God! the
shame you have borne so bravely is to be
lifted off your brow at last. Mr Walcheren,
she has been a true and steadfast
wife to you! God grant you may reward
her!’</p>

<p>Frederick Walcheren stretched out his
hand, and drew Rhoda and her child within
the shelter of his arms.</p>

<p>‘May God forsake me,’ he answered, ‘if
I ever make her weep again!’</p>

<p>“John Strange Winter is never more thoroughly at home than when delineating
the characters of children, and everyone will be delighted with the dignified Madge
and the quaint Pearl. The book is mainly occupied with the love affairs of Terry
(the soldier servant who appears in many of the preceding books), but the children
buzz in and out of its pages much as they would come in and out of a room in real
life, pervading and brightening the house in which they dwell.”—<i>Leicester Daily Post.</i></p>

<p>THE CONFESSIONS OF A PUBLISHER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The much discussed question of the relations between a publisher and his clients
furnishes Mr John Strange Winter with material for one of the brightest tales of
the season. Abel Drinkwater’s autobiography is written from a humorous point of
view; yet here, as elsewhere, ‘many a true word is spoken in jest,’ and in the conversations
of the publisher and his too ingenuous son, facts come to light that are
worthy of the attention of aspirants to literary fame.”—<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
</div>

<p>MIGNON’S HUSBAND. (14th Edition.)</p>

<p>“It is a capital love story, full of high spirits, and written in a dashing style that

</div>

<p>THAT IMP. (12th Edition.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Barrack life is abandoned for the nonce, and the author of ‘Bootles’ Baby’
introduces readers to a country home replete with every comfort and containing
men and women whose acquaintanceship we can only regret can never blossom
into friendship.”—<i>Whitehall Review.</i></p>

<p>“This discursive story, dealing with life in a garrison town, is full of pleasant

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
